<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>

<p>This book is the first attempt which has been made
to write a connected history of the City of Auckland.
Although in years the city is comparatively
young, many of the events which have marked
its progress have already been forgotten. With
the exception, perhaps, of the principal incidents
associated with the foundation of the city, and a
most interesting account of the state of Auckland
in the early &rsquo;fifties, written by Mr. W. Swainson,
no period of Auckland&rsquo;s history has been adequately
dealt with. The lack of information has
made the task of writing a history a difficult one,
and may account for the fact that none has hitherto
been essayed. The need for such a book has been
felt for a long time, and it is only to be regretted
that the work was not taken in hand before, by
someone who had been a spectator or a participant
in the events described. To a writer who has not
had these advantages, his work must lack that element
of the personal which adds to the interest of
the reader, and helps in the re-presentation of the
events.</p>

<p>The author&rsquo;s intention in writing this sketch has
been to group into periods the principal events and
incidents of the city&rsquo;s history. He has concentrated
his efforts to make these&mdash;the groundwork of any
history&mdash;as full and correct as possible. In a
pioneer effort it is only natural to expect some
omissions, and the writer hopes that his readers
will acquaint him upon any matters which he may
have inadvertently overlooked. He also hopes that
the appearance of the book will stimulate some of
the older residents of the city to record their recollections,
so that those of the younger school who
are interested in the city&rsquo;s past may have fuller
information about Auckland of the early days.</p>

<p>The writer wishes to acknowledge the assistance
which has been uniformly extended to him when
prosecuting his inquiries, especially to the officers
of city institutions whose histories have not so far
been made public, and to other individuals who
have assisted him in a more personal way. To all
of these he offers his thanks. Especially must he
thank Mr. George Graham, who, at his request,
prepared the sketch of the Maori history of the
Isthmus, which forms a prologue to the later history
of Auckland. Without this contribution, this
history would only have been partial; as now presented
it is a complete outline of the city&rsquo;s history
from earliest known times to the present.</p>

<h3>I<br />
<i>Introduction</i></h3>

<p>In compiling this history, I desire to narrate in
as brief and clear a manner as possible the doings
of the ancient Tamaki tribes, as recounted in the
folk-lore of their descendants.</p>

<p>I have, as far as possible, confined the history
to the tribes of the Auckland Isthmus itself&mdash;referring
to the history and peoples of other parts only
so far as is necessary to the clearness of the general
narrative.</p>

<p>There may be some doubt as to the chronological
sequence and to many of the details of incidents
herein related&mdash;such is inseparable from the legendary
history of all races who did not possess
written records.</p>

<p>However, the narrative as I now present it is
in the form accepted by the people&mdash;as related to
me by that generation of chieftains now almost
passed away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE EARLIEST INHABITANTS OF TAMAKI</h4>

<p>Ancient Maori culture did not embrace the knowledge
of letters. We therefore possess no written
records of the pre-European times. Our information
is confined to the tribal folk-lore and folk-songs
of the people.</p>

<p>We do know, however, that from a very remote
past the Pacific had been peopled by races of a
more or less Polynesian type, and that branches of
these had also reached New Zealand.</p>

<p>Legend tells us that the earliest settlers in
Ao-tea-roa were a race of giants&mdash;the &ldquo;Kahui-tipua.&rdquo;
Of that ilk was one Mata-aho, who had
no doubt arrived from lands of a more genial
temperature. He called upon his Fire-Goddess
(Mahu-ika) to produce subterranean fires to warm
his limbs. Hence the volcanic outbursts which have
left evidence of the efficiency of that ancient invocation
in the form of the extinct volcanic cones
and lava flows of the Tamaki Isthmus.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was an equally ancient, but
more human-like people resident hereabouts&mdash;the
&ldquo;Patu-paiarehe&rdquo;&mdash;so-called &ldquo;Fairies,&rdquo; from whom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
indeed, many of the leading chieftains of to-day
proudly claim descent. Concerning these people
we are told of their industry in the arts of peace,
fishing, hunting, weaving, etc.; nor were they, it
would seem, deficient in the sterner art of war, for
they were involved in much inter-tribal strife. One
of these struggles resulted in a weaker faction deciding
to emigrate across the Waitemata. In order
to do so they began to erect a stone causeway.
However, the sun arose on their uncompleted toil,
and dried them all up! The ruin of this ancient
attempt to bridge the Waitemata remains to this
day in the form of that long reef &ldquo;Te Toka-roa,&rdquo;
off Point Chevalier. The unsentimental geologist
will tell you it is actually an old lava flow from
Mount Albert.</p>

<p>Despite the mists of legendary lore which surround
the doings of these ancient people, both
&ldquo;Giants&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fairies,&rdquo; it is probable that they
had actually existed here. They were, perhaps, the
earliest of the immigratory races which were continually
arriving. Over the Pacific Ocean canoe
voyages were taking place in all directions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
motive which impelled these undertakings was
doubtless that stated in the legends&mdash;overpopulation
involving warfare, causing the weaker factions
to seek safer homes over the water to live in. No
doubt the food supplies of over-populated islands
also necessitated sections of the people to swarm
off; the mere spirit of adventure, ever in the human
heart, was probably an important contributory
cause.</p>

<p>Whoever these ancient people were&mdash;and the
probability is that they were Polynesians similar
to the immigrants of a later time&mdash;they were a
numerous people who &ldquo;covered the land like ants&rdquo;;
such is the proverbial description of them.</p>

<h3>II<br />
<i>Toi-te-huatahi</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>

<p>Some time about 1150 A.D. there arrived in New
Zealand a chief named Toi-te-huatahi, the leader
of a large immigration, who settled at Whaka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>tane,
and his people, known as Te Tini-o-Toi,
rapidly spread throughout the land, conquering
or merging with their predecessors. Tamaki was
soon populated by them. Oho-mai-Rangi, said to
be a son of Toi, lived at the Waikato Heads, and
to him is generally attributed the tribal name
&ldquo;Nga-Oho&rdquo;&mdash;a people of Toi who occupied a wide
area in the south, Waikato and Tamaki. A great-grandson
of Toi was one Kauea, who carried the
conquests of his people into the Kaipara and the
far north.</p>

<p>By the middle of the fourteenth century we find
the Nga-Oho dominant over all this area, having
various sub-tribal names, such as the Nga-riki,
Wai-o-hua, etc.</p>

<h3>III<br />
<i>The Arrival of the Fleet</i>&mdash;<i>1350 A.D.</i></h3>

<p>About 1350 A.D. came another wave of immigrants
from Polynesia&mdash;for then arrived the historic
fleet of canoes, the Arawa, Tainui, Matatua,
and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be remarked here that this was the last
of the great Polynesian immigrations. From very
remote times expeditions had been arriving in New
Zealand, and many return voyages were likewise
made to the Pacific groups. Why these voyages
eventually ceased, at a time when among the Polynesians
the arts of navigation had been brought to
perfection, remains an unsolved problem.</p>

<p>The fact remains that this immigration of about
1350 A.D. was an epoch-making affair, and from
this time on Maori history assumes a definite form.
We now reach an era of which we possess more
definite detail as to the doings of the Tamaki tribes
down to European times. From 1350 A.D. the
next century or so is mainly a record of the settlement
of the immigrants, involving much inter-tribal
warfare.</p>

<h3>IV<br />
<i>The Tainui Canoe</i></h3>

<p>Of these canoes, the one which most directly
affected local history was the Tainui canoe. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
canoe, like most of the others, arrived on the
East Coast. Coasting northwards (some say as far
as the North Cape) she arrived at last in the Hauraki
Gulf, and entered the Waitemata. Resting
for some time at Te Kurae-o-Tura (Devonport
Beach), the canoe continued its journey to Tamaki
(Otaiki). At Taurere (Tamaki Heads) a chief
named Te Kete-ana-taua remained with the local
people, and became the ancestor of Ngai-tai of
those parts; they were owners of all the Takapuna
district as far north as probably Mahurangi, and
included in their territorial areas the Kawau, Great
Barrier and other islands of the Gulf.</p>

<p>Arriving at Otahuhu, the people awaited the
re-arrival of an important lady of their party, by
name Marama. This lady, having landed at Hauraki,
was doing &ldquo;the overland trip.&rdquo; On her ladyship&rsquo;s
arrival, the canoe was taken into the Manukau,
whence they voyaged southwards to Mokau,
eventually settling at Kawhia. From there they
spread inland to Waikato, Hauraki, and eventually
to Tamaki. Marama, with other members of the
Tainui crew, also settled here, her descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
being known as the Nga-Marama people. Hence
the Tamaki Isthmus became a Tainui tribal area
at a very early period.</p>

<i>The Arawa Canoe</i></h3>

<p>The Arawa people at an early date also contributed
its quota to the population of Tamaki.
Arriving on the East Coast (at the same time
and place as the Tainui) this canoe likewise made
a coastal exploration. Eventually its people settled
down at Maketu (Bay of Plenty), Tamatekapua,
their leader, having remained at Moehau (Cape
Colville), where he died. From there his children
spread throughout the Coromandel peninsula and
the islands of the Gulf, and were known as Ngati-huarere
(Huarere being Tamatekapua&rsquo;s grandson).
We are told that Ihenga, a brother of Huarere, lived
at Tamaki for some time, and at Kaipara. These
early Arawas left descendants here, and through
them the Tamaki chiefs thus claimed an Arawa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
lineage. The Ngati-Huarere are said to have occupied
fortified villages at Orakei, Fort Britomart,
Queen Street, Three Kings and other places, until
the final conquest of the Tamaki Isthmus, as hereinafter
related. Kahumatamomoe, another son of
Tamatekapua, having quarrelled with his brothers
and relatives at Maketu, came to Tamaki, and is
said to have lived at Orakei with other relatives
already settled there, hence the name of the village
at Orakei&mdash;&ldquo;Okahu.&rdquo; Going on to Kaipara, he
permanently resided there.</p>

<h3>VI<br />
<i>The Matatua Canoe</i></h3>

<p>This immigrant canoe was also an important factor
in populating the Tamaki Isthmus. Its people
had settled at Whakatane, and were remarkable
for their restlessness. Parties of this tribe, known
under the general name of Ngati-Awa, were always
on the move. They are reputed to have formed
an important element of the One Tree Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
(Maungakiekie, lofty hill) people. The Owairaka
(Mount Albert) pa belonged to this people. The
Ngati-Awa chief Titahi, who lived in Tamaki and
Kaipara for some time, is said to have instructed
the local people how to perfect their fortifications.
Hence one name for the terracing and earthworks
(so conspicuous a feature of the hills of Tamaki)
was &ldquo;Nga-whaka-iro-a Titahi&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The decorations
of Titahi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intrusion of these various immigrant parties
no doubt was not peacefully accomplished, and
almost continuous warfare marks the history of the
next few centuries, as the direct result of the jealousy
between rival chieftains and the struggles of
the respective tribes to maintain and extend their
territories.</p>

<h3>VII<br />
<i>The Aotea Canoe</i></h3>

<p>This important canoe, commanded by the famous
Turi, also visited the Tamaki, the crew eventually
settling at Patea, in the South, but Turi&rsquo;s son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Turanga-i-mua, became dissatisfied with that place,
and about 1400 A.D. he came to Tamaki with a
war-party, moving on to Hauraki and other places,
finally returning to Tamaki. Tu&rsquo; soon came into
conflict with the local people, whom he defeated
in the battle at Waitaramoa (the creek at the head
of Hobson Bay), and then occupied the pa at
Onepuwhakatakataka (the headland at Orakei,
opposite Parnell). There he lived for some time,
and again left for the South, leaving a large number
of his people in possession of this locality,
where they occupied several villages. By intermarriage,
the Aotea people appear to have soon
lost their tribal unity, and from them the Tamaki
chiefs of a later time were proud to claim an
ancestral descent.</p>

<h3>VIII<br />
<i>Ancient Maori Society&mdash;A Retrospect</i></h3>

<p>Before going any further, a brief outline of the
daily life of the Maori community should be of
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The tribes of Tamaki lived in village communities,
each hapu, or community, consisting of a group
of families, more or less closely inter-related, and
governed according to various customary usages
by their hereditary chiefs. These communities
collectively acknowledged the superior prestige of
an Ariki, or hereditary high chief.</p>

<p>The religious side of life was the province of
their &ldquo;tohungas,&rdquo; or priests, the priesthood being
also hereditary within certain families of chiefs.</p>

<p>Each village was a fortress&mdash;palisaded and parapeted,
with deep trenches and draw-bridges. Every
hill-top, headland or locality lending itself to defence
was utilised for that purpose.</p>

<p>The aristocratic families lived in elaborately
built houses (similar to &ldquo;Rangitihi,&rdquo; the great
carved house in our Museum). The chieftains had
their residential quarters in the citadel of the villages;
whilst the great mass of the tribesmen lived
in mere thatched sheds, or in pit-dwellings. The
remains of the latter are numerous throughout the
Isthmus.</p>

<p>The plantations were on the easy cultivated flats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or slopes surrounding the villages, and were usually
so located as to be easily defended against
marauders.</p>

<p>Large stores of dried fish and preserved food of
all kinds, from forest, stream and sea, were kept
in store-houses within each village. To become
&ldquo;short of supplies&rdquo; was a reflection upon the industry
of such a village, which would go to great
lengths to conceal such a predicament.</p>

<p>The crops grown were the &ldquo;taro,&rdquo; &ldquo;hue&rdquo;
(gourd), &ldquo;uwhi&rdquo; (yam), and &ldquo;kumara.&rdquo; This latter
was indeed the &ldquo;staff of life,&rdquo; and its cultivation
occupied much of the time and industry of
the people. At harvest time these crops were gathered
into the store-houses and pits for winter use.</p>

<p>At early dawn the people were astir and about
their daily duties. After the morning meal, the cultivators
went forth to the plantations, the fishers to
the sea, and the hunters to the forest. Other men
were engaged in the building of houses or canoes,
in which the art of the carver was utilised, or in
the making of stone implements or weapons, whilst
the women of rank directed and actively took part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
in the domestic arts&mdash;garment weaving, mat and
kit plaiting, etc.</p>

<p>No individual was idle; to be so was a reproach,
and a failing not tolerated. The whole idea pervading
the community was the public weal, and
each individual did his or her &ldquo;bit,&rdquo; not for individual
profit, but <i>pro bono publico</i>.</p>

<p>At sundown the people withdrew to their villages
for the night. The gateways were closed, and sentries
were posted on the parapets. By their watch-songs
and calls throughout the night, the sentries
answered one another from village to village.</p>

<p>Within doors the communities, by night, amused
themselves and their visitors with dancing, songs
and folk-tales of ancestral doings. Such relaxation
is, indeed, the feature of Maori village life at the
present day.</p>

<p>The burial-places of the people were the caverns
of the Isthmus, each sub-tribe and family having
its own place of sepulchre. In some cases these
were in remote places of the forests of Waitakerei,
or other secluded localities. Of the many other
aspects of ancient Maori social economy, religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
rites, etc., and, above all, of the customs connected
with war, I must refer those interested to the many
excellent books dealing with the subject.</p>

<p>The above sketch will, however, give an idea of
the social status of the people in those ancient
times, when the events hereinafter described were
enacted.</p>

<h3>IX<br />
<i>The Wars of Tamaki</i></h3>

<p>It is hard to ascertain the actual causes and the
chronological sequence of the wars which followed
the arrival of the fleet, and only an outline is
attempted here.</p>

<h4>MAKI&rsquo;S INVASION FROM WAIKATO</h4>

<p>This chief, Maki, came from Ngati-Awa of Taranaki.
Coming northward with his people he seemed
to have gradually worked his way <i>via</i> Kawhia and
Waikato to Tamaki, capturing the Rarotonga
(Mount Smart) pa, where for a time he dwelt.
Here he was visited by the chiefs of Kaipara, descendants
of Titahi. They requested his assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
in warfare against the Kawerau, an ancient aboriginal
people, who had become intermixed with the
Tini-o-Toi. Responding to this invitation, and reinforced
by a large section of Tamaki people, he
invaded Kaipara with great success, attacking ultimately,
like Strongbow of old, the people whom he
had come to assist. He then turned his attention to
the Waitakerei and Mahurangi districts, with like
results, and extended his doings to the outlying
islands&mdash;Tiritiri, Kawau and Waiheke, finishing
up at Maraetai. Afterwards he departed as he
came, returning, it is said, to the southern districts
of Taranaki.</p>

<h4>KAWHARU&rsquo;S INVASION FROM KAIPARA</h4>

<p>This affair resulted from some tribal differences
in the Waitakerei-Kaipara borderland, about 1680.
Kawharu (who was a chief connected with the
Northern Ngati-Whatua) attacked the tribes in
those districts, driving all before him. He assaulted
also many of the Tamaki villages, continuing his
campaign until he reached as far as the Paparoa
headland, east of Howick. Capturing and destroying
the pa there, he returned to Kaipara.</p>

<p class="caption">

<span class="small"><i>After a painting shown at the Colonial Indian Exhibition, London</i></span></p>
</div>

<h4>WARS WITH HAURAKI GULF TRIBES</h4>

<p>To the south-east were the powerful Hauraki
coastal tribes, who, like those of Tamaki, had gone
through much the same history. Also descended
from the Patu-paiarehe, they had gradually incorporated
their pedigrees with those of the Tainui,
Arawa and other people. The earliest warfare on
record of Tamaki with these people originated (so
says the legend) when the Tamaki tribes slew the
pet seal belonging to the Hauraki people. Strange
to say, this animal (named &ldquo;Ureia&rdquo;) was on a
visit to Manukau Harbour, at the invitation of the
Tamaki people, and there it met its untimely end.
Surely the most unusual of Maori <i>casus belli</i>.
Maru-tuahu, as the tribes of the Hauraki district
were called, then invaded Tamaki. They attacked
among other places the Maunga-whau (Mount
Eden) pa. After various other successes they returned
homewards.</p>

<h4>THE MURDER OF KAHURAUTAO</h4>

<p>Subsequent to this affair was the warfare resulting
from the murder of Kahurautao, his son Kiwi,
and other Maru-tuahu chiefs. These people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
returning from Waikato by canoe <i>via</i> Manukau
and Tamaki. They had visited the Tamaki chiefs
at Mount Eden and other places, and on their return
to their canoes at the Tamaki River they were
waylaid and murdered near where St. John&rsquo;s
College now stands, hence the name of that place,
&ldquo;Paru-tahi&rdquo;&mdash;killed together. The Maru-tuahu
tribes, under Kahu&rsquo;s son Rau-tao, thereupon invaded
Tamaki. They attacked with success the
riverside pas at Tamaki, also those at Mount Eden,
One Tree Hill and Orakei. Crossing to Takapuna,
they scoured along the coast as far as Mahurangi.
Apparently all those people, being Ngai-Tai, were
of one tribal identity. This was not the last time
these coastal tribes suffered in this way.</p>

<h4>KAPETAWA&rsquo;S INVASION</h4>

<p>Thereafter occurred the affair of Kapetawa.
When a mere lad, this chief, while on a visit
from Waiheke to his sister, who had married Taramokomoko,
a chieftain of Kohimarama, got into
several scrapes, as boys were much the same then
as ever, but when he, as the ringleader with kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>dred
spirits, plundered the kumara store of his
brother-in-law, he got into disfavour with Taramokomoko,
who marooned him on the Bean Rock
off the shore. Being rescued by his sister, he returned
home, where he grew to manhood among
his own people, the Ngati-Paoa, at Waiheke. He
then organised a war party to avenge the long-remembered
insult. Surprising the pas at Kohimarama,
Orakei, etc., he crossed to Takapuna,
destroying several villages there and along the
outer coast, where the erring brother-in-law, the
cause of all this trouble, was caught and killed at
Raho-para&mdash;a pa on the northern headland of the
Wairau Creek (Milford).</p>

<h3>X<br />
<i>Kiwi Tamaki (1720-1750)</i></h3>

<p>We now come to the era of Kiwi Tamaki, the last,
and undoubtedly the most notorious, of the olden
Tamaki chiefs. He was so called to distinguish
him from other men of that name.</p>

<p>His parents, Te Ikamaupoho and Te Tahuri,
united in their ancestry all that was aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in lineal descent from the ancient Patu-paiarehe,
Nga-Oho (People of Toi), Ngati-Awa, Arawa, Tainui,
etc. Despite the many repeated invasions and
incessant warfare within their territories, the Tamaki
people at this time were apparently in their
&ldquo;golden age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The family home was the citadel of One Tree
Hill. The mother, Te Tahuri, was renowned for her
hospitality and industry. The resources of the district
and the extent of the fortifications and cultivation
were famous far and near. On the Manukau
and Waitemata, large fleets of canoes for fishing
and war purposes were maintained. Hence the proverb
&ldquo;Te pai me te whai-rawa o Tamaki&rdquo;&mdash;the
luxury and wealth of Tamaki.</p>

<p>The many previously described wars had ere
this earned for the Isthmus the appropriate motto
&ldquo;Tamaki-makau-Rau&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, The spouse contested
for us by a hundred lovers).</p>

<p>Surrounded by all this Maori opulence, Kiwi
grew to manhood. He early developed an arrogant
and turbulent disposition. When on a visit to
Ngati-Whatua to attend a funeral feast held near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Helensville, Kiwi treacherously slew several of the
local chiefs and a prominent chieftainess, named
Tahataha. Following this up with other murders
on his homeward journey, he reached the supposed
safety of his tribal domains. The Ngati-Whatua
promptly retaliated, and before Kiwi realised their
intentions, they arrived in canoes from Pitoitoi
(Brigham&rsquo;s Creek, near Riverhead) and successfully
attacked the Waitemata foreshore villages.
Kiwi then advanced, and met a Kaipara war party
coming overland, at Titirangi. After some skirmishing,
they defeated Kiwi, who returned to One
Tree Hill. The Ngati-Whatua then advanced to the
Tamaki Heads, where they captured the Taurere
pa, and again returned to Kaipara, losing some of
their chiefs in ambush near Remuera.</p>

<p>Returning, however, in greater force, one party
crossed the Manukau and attacked the Tipitai
(Awhitu) and other villages.</p>

<p>Kiwi had meanwhile organised his tribesmen,
and, reinforced from the southern districts, he advanced
against the Kaipara. The forces met again
at Titirangi. After much skirmishing, ending in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a feigned retreat, the Ngati-Whatua advanced
rapidly. The retreat became a &ldquo;debacle,&rdquo; only
ending on the shores of the Manukau, where at
Paruroa (Big Muddy Creek) Kiwi fell. All the
important Tamaki chieftains fell that day, hence
the name of this Maori Bannockburn, &ldquo;Te Rangi-hinganga-tahi&rdquo;
(The day when all fell together).</p>

<p>This battle took place about 1750. Tamaki was
now at the mercy of Ngati-Whatua, who advanced,
easily disposing of such defenders as remained to
dispute their progress.</p>

<p>Having depopulated Tamaki, Ngati-Whatua then
returned to Kaipara. On their departure, some of
the Tamaki refugees again returned to the Waitemata
and re-occupied several villages on the harbour
side. Ngati-Whatua, hearing of this, sent
another expedition, which attacked and finally
drove these people away. Tuperiri, the Ngati-Whatua
leader, and his tribesmen, then returned
to Tamaki and made their home at One Tree Hill
and other places. After capturing the last remaining
forts at Mangere, they held undisputed sway
over this land. Most of the Tamaki people had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
been slain. Some were enslaved, and a remnant
fled into Waikato and Hauraki.</p>

<p>Thus ends the story of the ancient tribes of
Tamaki.</p>

<h3>XI<br />
<i>The Ngati-Whatua Era in Tamaki</i></h3>

<p>Ngati-Whatua were now installed in possession
of Tamaki. They soon found that might was the
only right to their new territory. To the south were
the powerful Waikato and Marutuahu tribes, who
by sea and land were a continual anxiety to the
new lords of Tamaki. They were closely related
to the late victims of Ngati-Whatua. Many of the
refugees, indeed, had gone to those districts to
live, and no doubt instigated many a surprise
attack. Ngati-Paoa appear to have always maintained
several fortified villages on the Tamaki
River unmolested by Ngati-Whatua down to European
times.</p>

<p>Quarrels arose with Ngati-Paoa at last as the
result of a marriage of a Waikato chieftainess to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Te Putu, a Ngati-Paoa chief. Land on the Tamaki
River had been given to cement a tribal peace and
in honour of the union. Shortly thereafter, at a
fishing expedition off Mahurangi, Ngati-Paoa and
Ngati-Whatua quarrelled. The former attacked the
latter and killed Tara-hawaiki, son of Tuperiri.
Ngati-Paoa followed this up by invading Tamaki,
having in alliance with them the other Hauraki
tribes. The invaders were defeated by Ngati-Whatua
at Pu-ponga on the Manukau Harbour and
again at Rangi-mata-rau (Point Chevalier Beach).</p>

<p>On a later occasion a party of Ngati-Paoa were
surprised whilst shark-fishing at Kauri Point,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
survivors being left on the pinnacle rock (Niho-Kiore)
off there to drown.</p>

<p>Thereafter Ngati-Whatua, now in alliance with
Waikato and Manukau tribes, attacked Ngati-Paoa
at Putiki (Waiheke). In a final battle at Tamaki
West Heads, Ngati-Paoa were defeated, and thus
was ended that warfare. This event is placed about
1793, and permanently established Ngati-Whatua&rsquo;s
prestige and their possession of Tamaki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, Tamaki had become a rather unsafe
place of residence, and does not appear to have
been extensively occupied. In fact, Mount Eden
and many of the large hill forts had long been
abandoned, and their elaborate defences were
already in ruin and overgrown with scrub and fern.</p>

<p>About this period, also, came a great epidemic
remembered as the &ldquo;Rewharewha.&rdquo; It was probably
an influenza outbreak, and swept throughout
the land. No doubt this visitation further reduced
the Tamaki population, and therein lies the reason
why many of the old-time villages were abandoned
and passed out of history. The remnants of the
people, though still numerous, were unable to hold
the large hill fortresses against an enemy. Smaller
and easier defended positions only were maintained.</p>

<p>Tuperiri continued, however, to live at One Tree
Hill, and died there in the latter part of the eighteenth
century. Ngati-Paoa still resided in various
Tamaki River pas, but nothing remarkable appears
to have happened in Tamaki itself. About this
year (1793) there came the first of the Ngapuhi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
raids, the precursor of many such subsequent affairs,
which ultimately involved the Ngati-Whatua
of Tamaki. The cause of the first invasion by
Ngapuhi of these parts is not certain. The Ngapuhi
war party, after attacking the Hauraki people, appeared
to have come to the Tamaki Heads, and
there, at the West Head again, a battle was fought.
Ngapuhi were defeated at the hands of the local
people, only two canoe parties of their fleet escaping.</p>

<p>The event was followed up by a Hauraki invasion
of the northern districts <i>via</i> Kaipara, in which
Ngati-Whatua also took part. They returned after
many successes in the north, and thus closed the
Tamaki history of the Eighteenth Century.</p>

<h3>XII<br />
<i>The Nineteenth Century (1800-1840)</i></h3>

<p>Of this, the final epoch in the Maori history of
Tamaki, I will give but a brief sketch.</p>

<p>Of the years from 1800 to 1810 we know little.
In the latter year a second great epidemic swept
over these districts. This no doubt brought about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
a further depopulation of the Isthmus. About
1810, Ngati-Paoa again began to reside on the
Tamaki shores, and erected fortresses at Mauinaina
and Mokoia (Panmure).</p>

<h4>MARSDEN&rsquo;S VISIT</h4>

<p>In 1820, Marsden passed through the district on
his way northward. Going by Ngati-Paoa canoe
to Riverhead, he met the Ngati-Whatua chieftain
Kawau, who escorted him safely to Kaipara. Returning
to Tamaki with Kawau, he visited the Ngati-Paoa
villages at Tamaki, and met their chieftain
Te Hinaki, between whom and the Hauraki chiefs
Marsden succeeded in arranging a meeting, the
result being a tribal peace between these people.</p>

<p>This peacemaking occurred aboard the ship
<i>Coromandel</i>, in the Waiheke Passage. After again
visiting the Mokoia pa at Panmure, Marsden
finally left for the north overland.</p>

<h4>CRUISE&rsquo;S VISIT TO TAMAKI, 1820</h4>

<p>In the same year (1820), the Waitemata was
visited by Major Cruise aboard the ship <i>Prince
Regent</i>, ten days after Marsden&rsquo;s departure. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
was invited to the Tamaki settlements, and there
met the chief Te Hinaki. Cruise gives much detail
in his Journal of the local natives and their homes.</p>

<p>Now began in earnest the dreadful era of the
Ngapuhi raids. Their war parties were now armed
with the destructive firearms obtained by bartering
with the early traders to these coasts.</p>

<h4>TE KOPERU&rsquo;S INVASION</h4>

<p>A Ngapuhi chief had arrived at Tamaki in 1820,
apparently to attack Ngati-Paoa and Hauraki generally.
Ngati-Whatua came to assist Ngati-Paoa,
and the Ngapuhi attack on Mauinaina was repulsed.
Then Te Koperu was invited into the
fortress to make peace. There he was treacherously
murdered by Te Paraoa-rahi, a Ngati-Paoa chief.</p>

<p>This event was followed almost immediately by
Te Koperu&rsquo;s brother, Te Morenga, attacking the
Tamaki pas, and he severely punished Ngati-Paoa,
amply revenging Te Koperu&rsquo;s death.</p>

<h4>HONGI&rsquo;S INVASION</h4>

<p>The following year (1821) saw yet another attack
on the people of Tamaki. Hongi Ika himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
first then came on the scene. He had just returned
from England, and had met Te Hinaki in Sydney,
whence they both returned to New Zealand. Te
Hinaki had been warned in Sydney by Hongi as
to his intentions; he therefore prepared his fortifications
at Mokoia and Mauinaina for the storm
about to break upon his people. The Ngapuhi duly
arrived and began a blockade of the Tamaki forts.
After a long siege, accompanied by much skirmishing,
the Mokoia fort was captured. Te Hinaki himself
was slain, with a great number of his people.
After the incidents usual to such affairs had been
fully enacted, the Ngapuhi departed, to carry on
the war in the districts of Hauraki and the south.</p>

<p>For some years after the Ngapuhi invasion, the
Tamaki Isthmus appears to have been altogether
abandoned as a permanent residential area. It was
during this time a kind of &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land.&rdquo; Ngati-Whatua
retreated to the forest wilderness of Waitakerei
and Kaipara, or into the recesses of the
Waikato.</p>

<h4>D&rsquo;URVILLE&rsquo;S VISIT</h4>

<p>In 1827 D&rsquo;Urville visited the Waitemata. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
ascended Takarunga (Mount Victoria, Devonport).
Looking westward towards the Tamaki, he says
there were no signs whatever of any inhabitants.
Crossing the harbour, he found a deserted village
(perhaps Orakei). He also attempted to ascend
what was probably Mount Eden, but had to abandon
the attempt. The denseness of growth of fern
and scrub since the time of the Ngati-Whatua
conquest of the last century had obliterated all
the old native tracks. The greater area of the Isthmus
had become little better than a jungle of
vegetation.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Urville also describes his visit to the villages
at Tamaki, where a namesake of the late ill-fated
Hinaki was then head man.</p>

<h4>NGAPUHI DEFEATED AT TAMAKI HEADS</h4>

<p>In this year (1827) was fought the last tribal
battle in Tamaki. The Manukau and Ngati-Whatua
people in alliance came in canoes down the Tamaki
River to give combat to Ngapuhi. That people,
crossing from Waiheke, &ldquo;captured&rdquo; the apparently
abandoned canoes of the local people at the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Tamaki Head. While Ngapuhi were quarrelling
over the supposed &ldquo;spoils of war,&rdquo; the allies returned
and surprised them, with such success that
only one small Ngapuhi party of twenty men returned
home to tell the tale.</p>

<h4>THE COMING OF CHRISTIANITY</h4>

<p>Christianity was now beginning to show its influence
among the war-weary tribes of New Zealand,
and from now on until 1835 much inter-tribal
peacemaking was the order of the day.</p>

<p>In that year Ngati-Whatua began to return to the
Isthmus, but none of the old hill forts were re-occupied.
The decrease in population, the introduction
of firearms, and the general change in the modes
of life had made those elevated places of abode
impracticable under the new conditions which
arose.</p>

<p>Okahu (Orakei Bay) became the headquarters
of the Ngati-Whatua; they had also a large village
at Mangere, where also lived Kati, younger brother
of Te Wherowhero,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the paramount Waikato chief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
His wife&mdash;Matere Toha&mdash;was a Ngapuhi chieftainess
of high rank, being a niece of the great
Hongi Ika.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Apihai Te Kawau, head chief of
Ngati-Whatua, took up his residence at Orakei, and
other villages were established and occupied on
the shores of the Waitemata and Manukau.</p>

<p>This was the position in 1840.</p>

<p>The days of local inter-tribal warfare had now
passed away for ever. In this year the purchase
of the site of Auckland City took place, and the
British Flag was unfurled at Fort Britomart. Thus
closed the long and troublous history of Tamaki-Makau-Rau.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I">Chapter I</a><br />
<i>Foundation and Settlement (1840-1850)</i></h2>

<p>The City of Auckland was founded on the 18th
September, 1840, by Captain William Hobson,
R.N., Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand. Captain
Hobson, on his arrival in New Zealand, made
his headquarters at the Bay of Islands, at that time
the most populous place in the colony, as far as
white people were concerned, for here both missionaries
and traders had settled in greatest numbers,
and here, also, Mr. Busby, British Resident,
was located. The Bay of Islands did not meet with
the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor, and, in his
first conversation with the Rev. Henry Williams,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
he asked for his opinion as to the most suitable
place to erect the capital of the young colony. The
Archdeacon recommended the Tamaki or the Waitemata.
The Surveyor-General, Mr. Felton Mathew,
visited both these localities, and favoured Tamaki,
which, if his recommendation had been adopted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
would have placed the seat of Government where
Panmure now stands. Captain Hobson, however,
decided to investigate the sites himself, and
in company with Mr. G. Clarke, Protector of
Aborigines, and Captain David Rough, who was
appointed &ldquo;Harbour Master at Waitemata&rdquo; in August
of this year, he sailed in the Revenue cutter
<i>Ranger</i>, commanded by Captain Carkeek, from
the Bay of Islands at the end of June, 1840.
After inspecting the channel at the Tamaki, the
Lieutenant-Governor decided against that site. He
then visited the upper reaches of the Waitemata
Harbour, and was again dissatisfied with the
channel. However, as Captain Rough had left the
vessel to take soundings near the Ponsonby shore,
and on the report of these being satisfactory,
Captain Hobson expressed his approval of the
Waitemata as the site of the capital, but did not
commit himself to a particular spot, and returned
to the Bay of Islands. In a despatch to the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, dated 15th October,
1840, Captain Hobson gives his reasons for
&ldquo;forming the seat of government on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
shore of the Waitemata,&rdquo; and continues: &ldquo;In the
choice I have thus made, I have been influenced
by a combination of circumstances: First, by its
central position; secondly, by the great facility of
internal water communication by the Kaipara and
its branches to the northward, and the Manakou
[sic] and Waikato to the southward; thirdly, from
the facility and safety of its port, and the proximity
of several smaller ports abounding with the most
valuable timber; and finally, by the fertility of the
soil, which is stated by persons capable of appreciating
it, to be available for every agricultural
purpose....&rdquo; In a later despatch, dated 10th
November, 1840, the Lieutenant-Governor states
that he had &ldquo;lately returned from a visit to the
Waitemata, where I found the officers of the Government,
and the mechanics and labourers under
their orders, proceeding with the necessary works
for establishing the town which I contemplate being
the future seat of Government, and which I purpose
distinguishing by the name of &lsquo;Auckland.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Hobson&rsquo;s choice of the capital was strenuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
opposed by the New Zealand Company, and its
agents endeavoured to have Wellington made the
seat of Government. The controversy between the
Governor and the Company lasted until 1842, when
Queen Victoria signified her approval of the Governor&rsquo;s
selection, notification of which appeared in
the &ldquo;New Zealand Government Gazette&rdquo; of November
26th, 1842. Auckland remained the capital
until February, 1865.</p>

<p>In September a move was made to occupy the
new site, the ship <i>Anna Watson</i> (Captain Stewart)
conveying the Government officers from the Bay of
Islands to the Waitemata, where they arrived on
the 15th. The vessel anchored off Freeman&rsquo;s Bay,
moving on the following day to an anchorage near
Point Britomart, where the deepest water was found,
and which was afterwards named Commercial Bay.
East of Point Britomart the officers of the expedition
took up their location in a pretty little bay,
which was named Official Bay, and in the next bay,
which received the name Mechanics Bay, the tradesmen
found accommodation. Here the making of
the city began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The following extract from <i>The New Zealand
Advertiser and Bay of Islands Gazette</i> of September
24th, 1840, sets forth in detail the ceremony
attending the establishment of the city:&mdash;&ldquo;The
barque <i>Anna Watson</i>, having on board several officers
of the Government, mechanics, labourers, etc.,
anchored in the Harbour of Waitemata on Tuesday,
the 15th instant, and the site for the intended
Settlement on its shores having been selected by
the Surveyor-General, on Friday, the 18th September,
at 1 p.m., the ceremony of taking formal possession
in the name of Her Majesty was duly performed.
The whole party having landed, the British
Flag was hoisted on a staff, erected on a bold
promontory commanding a view of the entire harbour.
The Flag was immediately saluted by twenty-one
guns from the <i>Anna Watson</i>, followed by a
salute of fifteen guns from the barque <i>Platina</i>,
after which Her Majesty&rsquo;s health was drunk at the
foot of the flagstaff, and greeted by three times
three hearty cheers. The <i>Anna Watson</i> then fired
a salute of seven guns in honour of His Excellency
the Lieutenant-Governor, which was responded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
by three hearty cheers, and &lsquo;one cheer more&rsquo; from
those on shore. The party then returned to the
<i>Anna Watson</i>, and, after partaking of luncheon, a
regatta took place between a five-oared gig belonging
to the Surveyor-General and a six-oared gig
belonging to the <i>Anna Watson</i>, both pulled in excellent
style by amateurs. This was followed by a
match for a purse of five pounds between two
whale-boats pulled by sailors, and by another between
two large canoes paddled by Natives. And
thus concluded the ceremony of founding the first
British Settlement established under the auspices
of the Government in this part of New Zealand;
a ceremony the more interesting, as this settlement
is intended for the future Capital of what we may
venture to predict will one day become a mighty
empire. The Officers of the Government present on
the occasion consisted of the <a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>Police Magistrate, the
<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>Colonial Surgeon, the <a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>Harbour-master, the <a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>Superintendent
of Works, the <a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>Sub-Protector of Aborigines,
and the <a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>Surveyor-General and his lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Auckland City had now begun its career. On the
17th October, Captain Hobson again visited Auckland,
but did not make an official landing until
14th March, 1841, when he was received with such
honours as the small community could furnish.
There was a guard of honour in attendance. A
procession was formed, and the Lieutenant-Governor
was escorted to the newly-erected official
residence. Shortly after the Lieutenant-Governor
had taken up his residence in Auckland, New Zealand
was proclaimed, on 3rd May, 1841, to be
independent of New South Wales, and Captain
Hobson continued in office, becoming Governor
instead of Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>Captain Hobson did not long survive the foundation
of Auckland. He died on September 10th,
1842. His remains were interred in the burial-ground
at Symonds Street, all the officers of the
Government, as well as the civilian population,
being present at the funeral. In a political sense
we have no interest in Captain Hobson, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
question of the choice of the Waitemata as the
capital has an interest for us. We feel constrained
therefore to pay tribute to the man who chose, with
the instinct of a city-maker, the site upon which
Auckland now stands. He discarded the Tamaki,
for its obvious defects; he rejected the upper
reaches of the Waitemata, and he chose the situation
which has proved to be the most natural and
effective for a new and constantly-increasing city.
Other men, such as the late Sir John Logan Campbell,
may have more substantial claims in actual
work for the community and in precedence of time
to the title of &ldquo;Father of Auckland&rdquo;; for Logan
Campbell had settled in the Waitemata before Captain
Hobson had fixed upon Auckland as the site
of the city, but in actually making the choice, Hobson
is, I claim, entitled without opposition to be
called the father of Auckland.</p>

<p>Auckland in the early &rsquo;forties had a very different
appearance from the city of to-day. Indeed, it
is one of the fascinations in writing about Auckland
to follow its growth from untamed natural
country to a city state; it is also one of its draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>backs,
for changes have been so rapid and thorough
that the original condition is completely obliterated.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the original town (see <a href="#image006">Land
Deed of the City of Auckland</a>, <i>f.</i> p. 40) were as follows:&mdash;It
commenced at Cox&rsquo;s Creek and followed
the coast until Hobson&rsquo;s Bay was reached at a
point where Brighton Road now meets the waterfront,
thence inland in an irregular line to Mount
Eden, and from there back to Cox&rsquo;s Creek. The
waterfront naturally shows the greatest alteration.
Commercial Bay was the principal part of the
waterfront. At that time the sea came right up to
the foot of Shortland Crescent. Commercial Bay
then swept eastward to a headland, which was
first called Flagstaff Hill, but was renamed
Point Britomart, after H.M. brig <i>Britomart</i>. Later
still, when the promontory was utilised as a military
station, the &ldquo;Point&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;Fort.&rdquo;
Continuing in the same direction were Official and
Mechanics Bays. On the western side the most
prominent bay in proximity to the city was Freeman&rsquo;s
Bay. The appearance of the waterfront at
this period was more picturesque than at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
present time; the bays were prettier, and the
vegetation covered the land right to the water&rsquo;s
edge.</p>

<p>Sir John Logan Campbell, in the interesting account<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
of his pioneer experiences, gives a graphic
picture of Auckland a few weeks after the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s
visit, when he settled the site of
the capital. &ldquo;The capital!&rdquo; he writes&mdash;&ldquo;a few
boats and canoes on the beach, a few tents and
break-wind huts along the margin of the bay, and
then&mdash;a sea of fern stretching away as far as the
eye could reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first consideration of the Government officials
and mechanics was to provide housing for
themselves and then to make buildings for the
requirements of the young community. The eastern
side of the town was the first to show
growth. In 1842 (see <a href="#image008">map</a> <i>f.</i> p. 48), there were
a considerable number of houses along the waterfront
as far as Mechanics Bay. Both sides of
Shortland Crescent (<i>now</i> street) had houses built
on it. Queen Street also had a number of build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ings,
which diminished in number as the street
continued southward, and practically finished at
Victoria Street, with an isolated dwelling here
and there beyond. The <a href="#image009">sketch</a> of Auckland in
1843 (<i>f.</i> p. 53), reputed to have been made by
Captain D. Rough, conveys a good impression
of the town at that date. It is the earliest
existing picture we have of Queen Street, and depicts
the condition of living in those days. The
roads are unformed, the houses are all built of
wood, and there is no wharf. Outside the Court
House are to be seen stocks, in which wrong-doers
did penance for their evil deeds.</p>

<p>Sir John Logan Campbell provides us with a
picture of the social and economic conditions of
the early days in the book<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from which I have
already quoted. &ldquo;My large establishment, representing
not only the firm&rsquo;s business premises, but
the resident partner&rsquo;s place of abode, consisted as
of old, of the historical tent. It had been pitched
where a little trickling thread of water ran past,
and I had dug a little well, which gave me a plenti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ful
supply, and got hold of an old flour-barrel to
put in the hole. I had also fenced myself off from
the gaze of passengers, as the great thoroughfare
from Store [Commercial] to Exclusion [nickname
of Official] Bay passed in front of my tent. I had
stuck up some poles and clothed them with ti-tree,
so that I might have a screen behind which I could
carry on all my domestic duties.... I used to
get up at sunrise, often before it, and go away
foraging for wood, which I brought home from a
not far-distant patch of brushwood.... At the
back of my fence I had rigged up a triangle, from
which hung a hook on which to suspend my gipsy-pot,
and the fireplace was backed round with large
blocks of scoria stone, to prevent my fence from
being burned down. Here I did my modest cooking
to the oft-told MENU, pork and potatoes&mdash;not
a sheep or herd of oxen had yet reached the capital,
neither butcher nor baker had yet appeared on
the scene. We all were still our own cooks and
drawers of water, and jolly and well and happy
every one of us looked.... Very primitive were
our ways, as I have already stated. We had par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>sons
without churches, and magistrates without
courts; but we scrambled through our divinity and
our law somehow or other.... For instance, here
is an entry of date 15th May [1841]. &lsquo;To-day saw
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; sitting in front of his <i>whare</i> administering
justice under the canopy of heaven.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another interesting description of Auckland in
its cradle days is given in the Diary of Mr. Robert
Graham, one of the immigrants by the <i>Jane Gifford</i>,
which arrived in Auckland on October 9th, 1842.
Under the date October 12th, he records:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The town of Auckland lies in a hollow, and
the houses are built close down to the beach. Some
of them are very &lsquo;natty&rsquo;. Shortland Street appears
to be the principal street. In the meantime, the
first shop is a grog shop; the next is Mr. McLennan&rsquo;s;
the third a shoemaker&rsquo;s; the fourth a
baker&rsquo;s; then a grog shop; next a pork stand; and
then another grog shop. There seems to be a grog
shop for every three of all the other trades put
together. Shortland Crescent is a pretty steep hill.
On the top of it is the church, the Customs-house,
bank and the public buildings, and adjacent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
barracks. A road leads to Manukau, a distance of
ten miles, where a coach can run the whole way.
Mr. Gould and I went out this road four miles
to a place called Epsom. There is a little cultivation
going on there, but none nearer the town. Saw
some nice cottages and fine gardens, and two farms
of about ten acres, each under cultivation in wheat
and barley. There were also two herds of cattle
with bells on their necks to indicate their whereabouts
when in the fern, which is everywhere
around. Observed one plough at work, drawn by
two bullocks. The Maoris to be seen about are
seemingly quite happy, fond of smoking; and appear
to have pork, fish and potatoes in abundance.
They are intelligent looking, have most pleasant
countenances, and are all mostly tatooed, the chiefs
in particular being elaborately so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Government had established itself at
Auckland, one of the first duties which it undertook
was to provide settlers with land. On April 19-20,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
1841, the first sale of town lots by auction was
held, and the figures realised were stupendous, due
to jobbing, which land sharks from Sydney and
other parts of Australia had fostered. According
to the official &ldquo;Gazette,&rdquo; only 116 allotments were
sold, the total area comprising 38 acres 1 rood
28 perches, realising £21,299 9s. In addition,
twelve allotments measuring 5 acres 3 roods 2½
perches were reserved for Government officers, and
realised £2,976 8s. 9d.</p>

<p>Among the names of the purchasers will be found
some of Auckland&rsquo;s most respected citizens, who
had the confidence, even in those early days, that
Auckland was destined to be a big city.</p>

<p>The size of the town allotments varied from
approximately a quarter to half an acre. The plan
of the town was the work of Mr. Felton Mathew,
Surveyor-General, its principal features being a
circus where Albert Park now stands, balanced on
the western side of Queen Street by a square, into
which Hobson Street and Victoria Street now intersect.
The sections were designed so that they had
a double front, one to the main street, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to a lane. Some of these lanes survive to the
present, for example, High Street. The principal
streets were 66 feet wide, the secondary streets 33
feet, and the lanes somewhat less. Unfortunately
for the city&rsquo;s future, the owners of sections subdivided
their lots, and the lanes automatically
became important thoroughfares. To-day these
narrow streets are completely congested with the
traffic, and widening operations must inevitably
take place. O&rsquo;Connell Street, one of those lanes
(where the first wooden house<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> erected in Auckland
stood for some eighty years), has just undergone
this process of widening, and others must
follow.</p>

<p>Following upon the sale of town lots, selections of
Government land comprising suburban allotments,
cultivation allotments and sections suitable for
small farms were offered for sale on September
1st of the same year. The first group of sections
was situated eastward of Mechanics Bay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
proceeding towards Hobson&rsquo;s Bay, which approximates
roughly to the Parnell district of to-day. These
allotments were each about four acres in size. Of
the twenty-five lots offered, eighteen were sold, and
realised £2910, the average price per acre being
£45 14s. 3d. The ten cultivation sections were
intended for market gardens, and were situated
&ldquo;about one mile to the southward of Mechanics
Bay, on low, swampy ground under Mount Eden.&rdquo;
Of these, ten were put up and eight sold, the total
revenue being £318, or an average of £13 5s. an
acre. The farm sections were situated on the flat
between Mount St. John, One Tree Hill and the
Three Kings, and varied from four to twenty-three
acres in extent. Thirty-eight sections were sold,
those fronting the proposed Manukau Road selling
readiest and realised £1598, the average price per
acre being £3 8s.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of this series of sales
was the subdivision and reselling by buyers of
their sections, with the idea of opening suburban
districts. Two of the places were named Parnell
and Epsom, which names still survive; but two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
others, named Anna and Windsor Terrace, have
passed from local knowledge. Charles Terry,
author of &ldquo;New Zealand: Its Advantages and
Prospects as a British Colony,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> published in
1842, caustically remarks: &ldquo;The towns of &lsquo;Anna,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Epsom,&rsquo; etc., with reserves for churches, market
places, hippodromes, with crescents, terraces and
streets named after heroes and statesmen, were
then advertised with all the technical jargon with
which colonial advertisements are characterised.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The population of Auckland in 1841 was estimated
by the Colonial Secretary of the day, Mr.
Andrew Sinclair, to be 1500 persons. In 1842 it
had grown to 2895, due to the influx of settlers
following upon the foundation of the capital, and
also to the arrival of 500 immigrants by the ship
<i>Duchess of Argyle</i> (667 tons, R. G. Tait, captain)
and the barque <i>Jane Gifford</i> (558 tons, Captain
Paul). These vessels arrived in the harbour on the
same date, October 9th, 1842. They were the first
ships to bring British immigrants direct to Auckland.
Their port of departure was Greenock, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
naturally, the Scottish element predominated among
the new arrivals. The Scottish sentiment, which is
quite a feature of Auckland, may be traced back
to those immigrants. The passengers of these two
ships held reunions every tenth year from 1852 to
1892 on the anniversary&mdash;10th October&mdash;of their
landing in Auckland. Out of these gatherings has
developed the Old Colonists&rsquo; Association, membership
of which is confined to colonists of fifty years&rsquo;
standing and their descendants. The meetings have
been held annually since 1898.</p>

<p>The Government was not prepared for such a
large influx of immigrants as these two ships had
brought. The domestic servants and some of the
men were able to obtain employment, but the families
were not so fortunate, and they had to be content
with the rough accommodation which hastily-built
whares could give them. The ship <i>St. George</i><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
arrived soon after, with over ninety boys from
Parkhurst Prison on board. They were placed
under the care of Captain Rough, in his capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of Immigration Agent; but he found them less
agreeable subjects to deal with than the earlier
immigrants. On the 31st March, 1843, the ship
<i>Westminster</i> brought to Auckland a very good class
of immigrants, mostly English, and on this occasion
the Immigration Agent was better able to provide
for their reception than formerly.</p>

<p>The conditions of the young city in its earliest
years were not enviable. The work of pioneering
was exceedingly strenuous. Employment was difficult
to obtain, for none of the settlers had much
capital to work upon, and the Government had
little enough in the Treasury, and none to spend
on public works. Despite discouragements and
disappointments, the settlers were patient, endured
the hardships&mdash;and hoped. By 1844, with the
advent of Governor Fitzroy (December 23), steps
were taken to absorb those, who had not received
private employment, upon road formation. Captain
Rough, whose name we have already mentioned
as Harbour Master and as Immigration
Officer, might as well have borne the name of Pooh
Bah, for to him was given charge of this work. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
his reminiscences, he says: &ldquo;As there was at that
time no superintendent of works, I was asked to
take the business [of road making] in hand, and
though little acquainted with such matters, yet, by
getting an intelligent and practical foreman, and
letting out divisions of the work to be done by
contract to parties of immigrants, we managed in
the course of eight or ten months to cut down the
upper part and fill up the lower part of Shortland
Street, to form and metal Princes Street and Queen
Street, which previously were almost impassable in
wet weather; and also to clear and make the roads
to the Tamaki and Onehunga districts, as well as
to blast and to cut through a spur of Mount Eden,
filling up an almost insatiable swamp, and thus
opening and forming the road to Newmarket called
the Khyber Pass, the terrible massacre of British
troops in Afghanistan being much in mind at that
time. The improvements executed in the course of
twelve months found employment for the immigrants
and were very cheering and satisfactory to
the town people and to country settlers. To myself
the superintendence was a somewhat arduous addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>tion
to my duties afloat, but still I look back at it
as having been one of the most interesting and
useful occupations of my life in New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1843, the first conflict with the Maoris took
place at Wairau, and in the following year Hone
Heke&rsquo;s rebellion began. These events are outside
the scope of this sketch, except in so far as they
react upon the city&rsquo;s history. The destruction of
Kororareka by Heke&rsquo;s followers caused many of
the settlers to come to Auckland, and created consternation
and panic in the town itself. It was
feared that the rebels would follow up their success
in the Bay of Islands by attacking the capital.
The defences of the barracks were improved, and
entrenchments made, while the citizens were prepared
for eventualities by being drilled. As it happened,
the tide of war swept northward, and did
not reach the city. The consequence, however, as
far as the capital was concerned, was to retard
its progress. We do not need to enter into the
details of the war, except to anticipate its results.
Governor Fitzroy&rsquo;s conduct of the crisis was
unsatisfactory. He was recalled, and his successor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Captain George Grey,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> arrived in Auckland on 14th
November, 1845, and took steps which speedily
ended the war in the north. As Governor of New
Zealand and citizen of Auckland, he did much
for both. He was twice Governor (1845-53 and
1861-68), Superintendent of the Auckland Province,
1875, and he is the only Governor who
subsequently became a member of Parliament and
Premier of the Colony over which he formerly
governed. The greater part of his official and private
life is associated with this city. On his retirement
from the governorship, at the expiration of
his second term, he acquired the island of Kawau,
and there made his home. From then until 1894
he was closely identified with Auckland&rsquo;s development,
and it may be taken for granted that he held
the former capital in high esteem when he chose
to bequeath to it his collection of rare and valuable
books and manuscripts, as well as his pictures
and an ethnological collection of no little value.
He is to be ranked as one of Auckland&rsquo;s makers
and benefactors. A statue erected to perpetuate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
memory stands near the Town Hall. It was unveiled
on December 21st, 1904, by the Governor, Lord
Plunket. Mr. W. J. Speight, who was chairman of
the Memorial Committee, presided at the ceremony.</p>

<p>The Maori Festival which took place in May,
1844, on the outskirts of the city, near Mount St.
John, forms a contrast to the troubles which the
Government was having with the natives in the
North. This was a gathering of some two or three
thousand Maoris collected &ldquo;from various remote
districts of the Island ... for the purpose of still
more cementing that friendship and good feeling
which their now superior knowledge teaches to be
essential to their comfort and happiness.&rdquo; The
Governor (Captain Fitzroy) visited, on May 11th,
the ground where the festival was held, and was
well received by the natives, who danced hakas in
his honour. The following note on the feeding of
these thousands is taken from <i>The Southern Cross</i>
of May 18th, 1844. &ldquo;The preparations made for
the feast were enormous. A wall of potatoes in
baskets extended nearly for a quarter of a mile,
covered on the top with several thousand dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
sharks and dog fishes. Opposite to this potato wall
was a shade of the same length, covered over with
blankets, which were intended as presents to their
guests. The number of the blankets could not be
short of five hundred.&rdquo; The correspondent adds:
&ldquo;Some of our English manufacturers would have
relished such a sight.&rdquo; From what we have learned
from our investigations into those early days,
almost any of the settlers would have relished the
sight still more. At the time the population of
Auckland was only 2754 persons, and such a gathering,
while the native war in the North still continued,
must have caused no little concern both to
the authorities and the settlers.</p>

<p>A year after the capture of Ruapekapeka, on
January 11th, 1846, which ended the war in the
North, an attempt was made by Hone Heke to instigate
an attack on Auckland, and for this purpose
invited the Kaipara and Waikato chiefs to join
him. He sent messengers to Mangere, where they
met the Waikato chiefs, including Potatau (Te
Wherowhero), Kati, Te Wherepu, Taka-anini, Tutere,
Ngapora, and others. After conveying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
presents which Hone Heke had sent, and having
stated the object of their mission, Potatau consulted
with the assembled chiefs, and on the following
day returned a bag of bullets, which had formed
part of the gift Hone Heke had sent to him, and
declined to take part in the suggested attack upon
the Pakeha, stating that the chief of Ngapuhi would
have to dispose of his shadows first. Tuhaere
agreed with Potatau, saying, &ldquo;My word is one with
thine, O Potatau.&rdquo; The messengers returned home,
but Heke did not venture to attack with the other
tribes hostile, and so the project failed.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the earliest events of a domestic character
in the development of the city, the newspaper
must take a prominent place. The first newspaper
was born on 10th July, 1841, and was named the
<i>New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette</i>. It
consisted of four pages of very much smaller size
than a newspaper of to-day, and cost a shilling a
copy. Its circulation was 250 copies. Its career
was brief, the last issue being April 2nd, 1842.
The editors of the <i>Herald</i> were successively Charles
Terry, William Corbett, and Dr. Samuel McDonald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Martin, a fiery Highlander, whose trenchant articles
brought about the demise of the paper. It was succeeded
in a week&rsquo;s time by the <i>Auckland Standard</i>,
which had even a shorter career, four months
(April to August) being the extent of its vitality.
Its editor was William Swainson, who had come to
New Zealand to fill the position of Attorney-General.
<i>The Auckland Chronicle and New Zealand
Colonist</i> made its initial appearance on 8th November,
1841, but after a month&rsquo;s run it was suspended.
It revived in November of the following year,
and continued to appear until July, 1843. After
another suspension of two months it again appeared
and survived until 1845, when it finally disappeared.
Messrs. Kitchen and Barrow were the
editors, and Mr. John Moore was the printer. On
September 5th, 1842, the <i>Auckland Times</i> made
its <i>début</i>. On its first appearance it was printed
by Mr. Moore from type which had been used by
the printer of the <i>New Zealand Herald and Auckland
Gazette</i>. This type had been purchased by the
Government on the winding-up of that paper. For
some reason the Government forbade the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the type to Mr. Henry Falwasser, the editor and
proprietor of the <i>Times</i>. Mr. Falwasser was not
deterred by this refusal, and collecting all sorts
and sizes of types, and with the aid of a mangle,
he continued to bring out his paper under such
unique conditions for about thirty successive issues.
Dr. T. M. Hocken, whose researches in the
byways of New Zealand bibliography are of such
value to students, and to whom I am indebted for
much information, remarks that if the production
was &ldquo;not a confusion of tongues, it was certainly
a confusion of letters.&rdquo; The last of these curious
issues appeared on the 13th April, 1843. It
reappeared on November 7th in conventional form,
and continued until its one hundred and fifty-ninth
number, 17th January, 1846.</p>

<p>With the <i>Southern Cross</i> and the <i>New Zealander</i>
we arrive at something like stability. The promoter
and first editor of the former was Dr. Martin,
whose association with the first Auckland paper
has been mentioned. The proprietors were Messrs.
Brown and Campbell, who as business men were
pre-eminent, being interested in practically every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
local commercial venture. <i>The Southern Cross,
New Zealand Guardian, and Auckland, Thames,
and Bay of Islands Advertiser</i>, to give the paper
its full title, appeared on April 22nd, 1843, and
continued regularly until its one hundred and sixth
number (April 26th, 1845), when it was suspended
because it proved unprofitable. It resumed publication
in July, 1847, with the title shortened to <i>The
Southern Cross and New Zealand Guardian</i>. In
June, 1851 (No. 415), it was enlarged, and in
May, 1862, it appeared daily. Shortly after its
change to a daily it was sold to Mr. (afterwards
Sir) Julius Vogel, and again resold, in 1876, to
Mr. Horton, who amalgamated it with the <i>New
Zealand Herald</i>, which had been founded in 1863.</p>

</div>

<p><i>The New Zealander</i> commenced its career on
7th June, 1845, during the suspension of the
<i>Southern Cross</i>. It was owned by Mr. John Williamson,
for many years Superintendent of the
Auckland Province and the Government printer of
the day. Shortly after the advent of the paper,
Mr. Williamson was joined by Mr. W. C. Wilson,
and they became partners in its publication. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
partnership lasted until 1863, when Mr. Wilson
retired, owing to his dislike of his partner&rsquo;s philo-Maori
policy at the outbreak of the Taranaki
campaign. Mr. Wilson then started the <i>New Zealand
Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i> immediately gained an
ascendancy over the <i>New Zealander</i>, which ceased
publication on the destruction by fire of its premises
in 1866.</p>

<p>The new paper continued to enlarge its hold and
influence, and in 1876, when Mr. Wilson died, it
was firmly established. He was succeeded by his
sons, and they were joined in partnership by Mr.
Horton, who had become the owner of the <i>Southern
Cross</i>, and ever since the name of Wilson and
Horton has been on the <i>Herald&rsquo;s</i> imprint. The
<i>Auckland Weekly News</i>, which was commenced
just two weeks after the <i>Herald</i>, holds the record
in New Zealand for a weekly paper, and has
attained a high place among the weekly journals.
Many men of outstanding ability have been
editors of the <i>Herald</i>, and contributions have been
made to it by the best writers the Dominion has
produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Herald</i> was first printed in temporary premises
in Queen Street, near Durham Street East.
Nine months later it was removed to Wyndham
Street, and from then (1863) until 1912 extensive
additions have been made at different times to meet
the increasing business which the firm has to
handle.</p>

<p>Between the &rsquo;forties and the present day many
other papers have been launched, and after brief
careers, have passed out of existence, but beside
the <i>New Zealand Herald</i> only the <i>Auckland Star</i>
(originally the <i>Evening Star</i>) needs mention, and
may be most fittingly dealt with here. The suggestion
for the commencing of the paper came
from Mr. William Tyrone Ferrar, who enlisted
the interest of Mr. George McCullagh Reed, and
on the 8th January, 1870, the first issue appeared.
Two months later they were joined in partnership
by Mr. Henry M. Brett, who became, in 1876,
sole proprietor and later managing director. In
1872 the paper was so firmly established that
the <i>Evening News</i> and <i>Morning News</i> gave up
business, and were purchased by the proprietors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of the <i>Star</i>. Mr. G. M. Reed retired from the
editorship in 1876, and was succeeded by the
present editor, Dr. Thomson W. Leys. The <i>Star</i>
commenced operations in Wyndham Street in the
building now occupied by the <i>Observer</i>; in 1884
it removed to Shortland Street, and in 1916 was
enlarged by the addition of a nine-storey building
in Fort Street.</p>

<p>Among the earliest institutions to be founded in
the town&rsquo;s history were the churches. Auckland&rsquo;s
first church was St. Paul&rsquo;s Anglican church, the
foundation stone of which was laid by Captain
Hobson on July 28th, 1841, the consecration taking
place two years later, on March 17th, 1843, at
which Bishop Selwyn, who arrived in Auckland on
May 30th of the previous year, officiated. This
building was situated in Emily Place, and is easily
located to-day by the monument erected in memory
of its first minister, the Reverend John Frederick
Churton, which stands in the reserve where the
church formerly stood. In the &rsquo;sixties this building
was demolished, except for the front gable and
tower, and was replaced by another structure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the Gothic style of architecture. Colonel Mould,
of the Royal Engineers, was the architect of this
church, which was a pleasing structure, both externally
and internally, but the commercial expansion
of the city spelt its doom. After having
served as a place of worship and a landmark for
more than fifty years, it was completely demolished
in 1895, and the present church at the corner of
Symonds Street and Wellesley Street was opened
on November 1st of that year. Mr. W. H. Skinner
was the designer of the new building, and Mr.
McLean was the contractor.</p>

<p>The first Roman Catholic church was St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Cathedral, the foundation stone of which
was laid by Bishop Pompallier in 1846. The building
was located in Wyndham Street, and was completed
in 1848. It was dedicated on the Feast of
St. Joseph by the Reverend Dr. Viard, Coadjutor-Bishop.
Additions were made to the structure in
1884, amounting almost to a new building, and
again in 1908.</p>

<span class="small"><i>P. J. Hogan, delt.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>The Presbyterian Church had no church building
until 1850. Prior to this it held its services in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
buildings designed for less spiritual purposes. In
1843 the adherents of this Church used the Supreme
Court, Queen Street, where, it is said, the
ruling elders sat in the dock as their bench of
honour! The first church&mdash;St. Andrew&rsquo;s&mdash;was
commenced in 1847, and opened for divine service
on April 7th, 1850. It cost £3500. Originally it
was a very plain building, but with later additions,
including the tower, which was erected in 1882, it
has now quite a commanding appearance. The
additions and alterations were made from the plans
of Mr. Matthew Henderson, and cost £3000. Mr.
J. J. Holland was the contractor. The Rev. A. G.
Panton was the first minister. The Presbytery of
Auckland was formed six years later, on October
14, 1856, the Rev. John Mackay being appointed
first Moderator.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan denomination commenced its ministration
early in the &rsquo;forties, and, in 1843, a small
weatherboard church was erected in High Street, on
a site granted by the Government. The building was
a modest one, costing £246. It was superseded by a
brick church, which was erected and opened in 1848.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Commercial development rendered a banking
concern a necessity. The first bank to be opened in
Auckland was the New Zealand Banking Company,
which had commenced its career at Kororareka.
In July, 1841, a branch was instituted at Auckland
in premises which were situated in Princes Street,
near the site occupied by the Grand Hotel of to-day.
Mr. Alex. Kennedy was the manager. Beyond these
meagre details, the writer has not been able to
obtain satisfactory information about this bank&rsquo;s
subsequent history.</p>

</div>

<p>The Auckland Savings Bank commenced its career
on June 5th, 1847. The trustees transferred
their property to the Government in 1848, and
under its auspices continued to operate, an office
in the Union Bank of Australia being used, and
here it remained until 1854, when a room adjoining
the Colonial Bank of Issue was granted by
the Government for the use of the Savings Bank. In
1859 a site in Queen Street, being part of the site
upon which the bank still stands, was acquired from
the Provincial Council, and obtaining additional
land by purchase, the trustees decided, in 1860, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
erect a building of their own. The year 1876 saw
the inauguration of the Penny Savings Bank. The
present premises were opened in 1884 by the Governor,
Sir William Drummond Jervois. The architect
and contractor were respectively Mr. Edward
Bartley and Mr. J. Heron.</p>

<p>The establishment of a branch of the Union Bank
of Australia in 1848 in Auckland was an indication
of the commercial progress of the city. The building
in Princes Street, used at the foundation of the
bank, still stands next to the Northern Club. Later
the business was removed to offices at the corner
of Shortland Crescent and O&rsquo;Connell Street. In
1864 the present building in Queen Street was
occupied. The architect was Mr. Leonard Terry,
and the contractor Mr. Charles Brown, both of Melbourne.
The contract price was £9000, but with
extras the building cost approximately £10,000.</p>

<p>Early in 1842 (January 5th) the first race meeting
held in New Zealand took place at Epsom.
At what exact location this event was held the
writer has not ascertained, nor can he give any
information about the event itself. Despite this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
it is of interest to record the beginning of a sport
which has grown to such enormous dimensions.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court was opened on 28th February
of this year (1842), and occupied a site at
the corner of Queen and Victoria Streets. Here,
a week later, the first execution which took place
in Auckland was carried out on March 7th. The
victim of the law was a native, by name Maketu,
who was found guilty on a charge of murder. It
is related that a Government land sale was postponed
for an hour so that purchasers could witness
the event. The Court House was used until the
present building in Waterloo Quadrant was finished
in 1867. This building was commenced in 1863
by Messrs. Amos and Taylor, and completed by
Messrs. Mathews and Bartley. Mr. Edward Rumsey
was the architect.</p>

<p>The Auckland Hospital, reputed to be the first
hospital opened in the Dominion, was erected on
the site of the present Costley wards about 1845.
Dr. F. M. Philson was the first regularly appointed
medical officer. Up to the year 1883 the Hospital
was under the control of the Provincial and Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>eral
Governments. In this year the management
was delegated to a local committee, which administered
the institution until the passing of &ldquo;The
Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act, 1885,&rdquo;
when it vacated office to the newly-constituted
authority, consisting of representatives of local
bodies of the district, to which the financial responsibility
and management of the institution was
transferred.</p>

<p>The main block of the present Hospital was
erected in 1875-76. Mr. P. Herepath was the architect
and Mr. John Taylor the contractor. The contract
price was £19,249. The next notable addition
to the Hospital was made in 1898, when the Costley
wards were erected, at a cost of £5600. The chief
operating theatre, attached to the Costley block,
was built in 1905, and cost £2753. Subsequently
a surgical wing was added to the Costley block.
The Princess Mary Hospital for Children was
erected in 1917. The furniture of the Children&rsquo;s
Hospital was provided by the Auckland Vaudeville
Employees&rsquo; Association as a war memorial, the
association collecting a sum of £3152 for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>pose.
The typhoid wards, erected as a temporary
building in 1887 to cope with the severe typhoid
outbreak which occurred in that year, and the
Nurses&rsquo; Home are the other principal buildings of
the Hospital.</p>

<p>The Costley Home, One Tree Hill, which was
erected from funds bequeathed by the late E.
Costley, was opened by the Governor, the Earl of
Onslow, on April 23rd, 1890, and cost £8650 to
erect. The infirmary, adjoining the home, which
cost £5000, was opened on December 9th, 1907.
An addition to the latter building, which was made
in 1916, cost about £6300. The home is administered
by the Hospital Board.</p>

<p>During the war the Hospital had to meet heavy
demands made by the return of sick and wounded
soldiers. One of the Exhibition buildings, which
had been kept intact, was formed into an annexe,
while a house in Domett Avenue, Epsom, and the
residence of the late A. R. D. Watson at North
Head, were utilised as convalescent homes. The
Point Chevalier Hospital was also used for military
purposes in 1915.</p>

</div>

<p>Another institution which came into being during
the first decade of the city&rsquo;s history was the
Auckland Mechanics&rsquo; Institute and Library, which
was opened on 30th September, 1842. In addition
to a hall, which for many years was the only place
for meetings the town possessed, there was a library,
a reading room and official&rsquo;s residence. In
this humble building practically all the important
meetings of the town were held, and in it many of
the city&rsquo;s institutions and societies were born. The
building was situated in Chancery Street.</p>

<p>The first ship propelled by steam to arrive in
Auckland was H.M.S. <i>Driver</i>. She steamed into
the Waitemata on January 20th, 1846, the vessel
being in charge of Commander C. O. Hayes. Her
tonnage was 1058, and her horse-power 280. She
mounted four large guns, and carried a complement,
including marines, of 175. The first merchant
steamer to visit Auckland was the <i>Juno</i>, from
Sydney, which reached the Waitemata on July 7th,
1847.</p>

<p>The earliest fire of importance recorded in
Auckland was that which destroyed Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
House in June, 1848. The building was constructed
of wood, which was brought out in sections
from England, and in appearance resembled an
ordinary cottage. Fortunately, a sketch by Baron
de Thierry survives, and is preserved in the Auckland
Old Colonists&rsquo; Museum. The destroyed building
occupied a site within the grounds of the present
Government House property.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II">Chapter II</a><br />
<i>Development: 1851-1870</i></h2>

<p>The advent of the second decade of Auckland&rsquo;s
history finds the town passing from the cradle
stage to one of more independence. Until the
year 1851 Auckland had been variously described
as &ldquo;the town,&rdquo; &ldquo;the seat of government,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
capital.&rdquo; In other words, it had been fostered
by the Government. Now, by a Proclamation of
the Governor, Sir George Grey, it was elevated to
the position of a borough, with a corporation&mdash;the
first to be created in New Zealand&mdash;to which
was given the powers of self-government on all
matters of local interest. The elections were held
on November 18th, and resulted in the return of
the following gentlemen:&mdash;Messrs. Edwin Davy,
Archibald Clark, Patrick Dignan, F. W. Merriman,
A. B. Abraham, James O&rsquo;Neill, S. Norman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
T. M. Haultain, J. A. Hickson, A. Macdonald,
Joseph Newman, William Powditch, William I.
Taylor, and W. Mason. On November 25th
the councillors were sworn in, the event taking
place at the Court House, Auckland, before the
Chief Justice (Sir William Martin), and in the
presence of Lieutenant-Governor Wynyard and the
naval, military and civil officers of the Government,
as well as the officers of the 58th Regiment,
the clergy, a numerous assemblage of ladies and
a great concourse of burgesses, the day being observed
as a special public holiday in honour of the
occasion. To the accompaniment of a flourish of
bugles the names of the gentlemen chosen to be first
Mayor and aldermen of Auckland were announced
as follows:&mdash;Mayor, Mr. Clark; aldermen, Messrs.
Dignan, O&rsquo;Neill, Powditch and Mason. Thereafter
the Charter of Incorporation was read, and the
Lieutenant-Governor delivered an address, in which
he stated to the councillors that &ldquo;it cannot fail to
be a matter of gratifying personal distinction to
yourselves to be selected from upwards of fourteen
hundred burgesses to fill the office and discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the duties of the first Council of the first Corporation
established in this country, under the immediate
sanction of the Royal authority.&rdquo; The ceremony
ended with the guard of honour presenting
arms, while the band played the National Anthem,
and a salute of twelve guns from the battery at
Fort Britomart was fired. The first meeting of the
Council took place a week later in the Legislative
Council Chamber, which had been placed at the
disposal of the Corporation by the Government.</p>

<p>The Borough Council did not last long, owing to
the disallowance in England of the &ldquo;Land Fund
Appropriation Act,&rdquo; upon which the Corporation
depended chiefly for its revenue, and on the passing
of the Constitution Act of 1852, its existence
terminated. Despite its short life, it is worthy of
record as an historic fact.</p>

<p>Auckland&rsquo;s municipal history during the remainder
of this period is not of much interest. In
1854 &ldquo;An Act to Provide for the Municipal Government
of the City of Auckland&rdquo; was passed by
the Provincial Council. This Act was repealed in
1856, and the powers contained therein transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
to the Superintendent of the Province. The next
attempt to develop local government was made in
1862, when the &ldquo;Town Boards Act&rdquo; was passed by
the Provincial Council; it was repealed the next
year, and was superseded by the &ldquo;City Board Act,
1863.&rdquo; Finally, &ldquo;The Municipal Corporations
Act, 1867,&rdquo; was passed, and under this Act the
city was constituted by Proclamation on April
24th, 1871. It has continued to be governed by
that Act and its amendments up to the present
time.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the Borough of Auckland,
as originally proclaimed, were wider than they
are now, and stretched across the Isthmus from the
Waitemata to the Manukau, and from the Whau
Creek to the Tamaki, an area of about 58,000
acres. The population of the borough was between
seven and eight thousand persons. W. Swainson<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
gives an interesting account of the state of the city
at this time. &ldquo;The principal streets are Princes
Street, Shortland Crescent, Queen Street and Wakefield
Street. The first is a broad, straight, spacious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
well-made street on a gentle slope; St. Paul&rsquo;s
Church, the Treasury and the Bank, and the Masonic
Hotel, are its principal buildings. Shortland
Crescent, which connects Princes Street with
Queen Street, is built on a rather steep ascent. It
is less broad than Princes Street, but much longer.
On one side [the right hand side going up from
Queen Street] it is almost wholly built upon; shops
and stores are here to be found of every description
and of various forms and style ... with
few exceptions, all are of wood. The roadway of
the street is an even macadamised surface, but no
attempt has yet been made to form footpaths on a
general level. Some of the shops would not disgrace
a small provincial town in England; though,
taken altogether as a street, Shortland Street is
irregular and unfinished. Queen Street is the least
built upon; but in other respects, it is the best and
most considerable street in Auckland. It is about
half a mile long, nearly level, and almost straight,
and terminates at its northern extremity at a pier
or quay which runs into the harbour, and alongside
of which small craft can land their cargoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
At its southern extremity it is overlooked by the
Wesleyan Seminary [now the People&rsquo;s Palace]
... a spacious brick-built and substantial structure.
The gaol<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is badly situated, and is by no
means a conspicuous building; but by a diligent
search it may be found on the west side of Queen
Street [at the corner of Victoria Street], partly
screened from view by the Court House and Police
Office, which abut immediately upon the street.
Several shops of superior description, two and
three storeys high, have recently been erected, and
Queen Street, besides being the longest, is certainly
just now one of the most improving streets
in Auckland. Wakefield Street ascends from its
southern extremity until it joins Cemetery Road,
and is the newest and most increasing street in
the town. Many of the houses are built of brick,
and it already bears a considerable resemblance to
a new street in the outskirts of a modern English
town.&rdquo; The same writer continues (p. 31):&mdash;&ldquo;The
most considerable public buildings are the Britomart
and Albert Barracks, having together accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>modation
for nearly 1000 men. The former are
built on the extremity of the headland dividing
Official from Commercial Bay, and form a conspicuous
but by no means an ornamental feature.
The buildings are solid and substantial, mostly of
scoria&mdash;a dark, grey, sombre-coloured stone&mdash;square,
heavy-looking and unsightly. The Albert
Barracks,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the larger of the two, are built upon
the same ridge, but about a quarter of a mile
inland. The Stores, Hospital, Magazine and Commissariat
Offices are built of scoria. The rest of
the buildings are of wood, plain in style, and of
a sombre colour. The various buildings, together
with the parade ground, occupy several acres,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
the whole of which is surrounded by a strong scoria
wall, about ten or twelve feet high, loop-holed and
with flanking angles ... the site, in a military
point of view, is not happily chosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>From the same informative book (p. 64 <i>et seq.</i>)
we obtain an interesting description of the social
life of the town, in which, of course, the military
element predominated. The author found that
Auckland resembled an English watering-place.
The houses were small and inconvenient, and many
of the people felt that they were only temporary
residents. The military part, with their families,
were always on the move. There was little formality,
little extravagance, and no ostentation; intercourse
was freer; originality more obvious than in
English towns; gossip more pronounced, but less
harmful than in the Old Country; political animosities
and religious bickerings were practically non-existent;
and, except that the dress of the people
was somewhat behind the fashion, one could not
believe that the English watering-place was so very
far away. As to amusements&mdash;&ldquo;Once a week,
during the summer, a regimental band plays for
a couple of hours on the well-kept lawn in the
Government grounds; and with the lovers of music
and those who are fond of &lsquo;seeing and being seen,&rsquo;
&lsquo;the band&rsquo; is a favourite lounge. Three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
balls in the course of the year, a concert or two,
an occasional picnic or water party, a visit to the
goldfield or to the Island of Kawau, a trip to the
Waikato or the lakes of Rotorua, are among the
few amusements which aid in beguiling the lives
of the Auckland fashionable circle; while dissipation
in the milder form of temperance and tea-meetings,
school feasts, stitcheries and lectures
suffices for the greater portion of the Auckland
community. To sportsmen the place offers few
attractions; the annual race meeting is the great
event of the year. Of hunting there is none; and
wild ducks, pigeons and curlew afford but indifferent
sport for the gun. Riding, boating, cricket
and bush excursions are the favourite outdoor
amusements. Once in the year nearly the whole
of the ball-going portion of the community are
brought together at a ball given by the Queen&rsquo;s
representative on the anniversary of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
birthday.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The cost of living is also dealt with. &ldquo;Almost
everything necessary to comfort and convenience
may now be procured in Auckland. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
cheaper than Wellington, Auckland is by no means
a cheap place of residence; certainly not more so
than an English town of the same size. House rent
and servants&rsquo; wages are at least double what they
are in England; but there are no taxes, rates or
dues of any kind. Clothing of all kinds is also, of
course, dearer in New Zealand than in England.
Wine, spirits and groceries are, for the most part,
cheaper. Bread and butcher meat are about the
same. The fish caught near Auckland, although
of but moderate quality, is plentiful and cheap.
Vegetables are also abundant; during the summer
of 1852 there were brought into market by the
natives, in canoes alone, upwards of 1100 kits of
onions (about twenty tons), upwards of 4000 kits
of potatoes (more than one hundred tons), besides
corn, cabbages and kumeras. Peaches grown by
the natives and sufficiently good for culinary purposes
are very abundant and cheap; during the
present summer upwards of 1200 kits were brought
into Auckland by canoes alone. Those who cultivate
a garden are well supplied with peaches,
strawberries, apples, figs, and melons; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
plums, pears, gooseberries and cherries are by no
means uncommon, although less abundant than the
former.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The economic conditions existing in Auckland
at the beginning of the &rsquo;fifties is stated and reflected
in a most succinct form in a <a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>Memorial sent to the
Governor (Sir George Grey) by members of the
Provincial Council of Auckland, setting forth the
reasons why they consider it a matter of justice
to Auckland that meetings of the General Legislature
of New Zealand should for the present be held
here. The memorandum is couched in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;That of the population of these islands, native and
European, estimated to amount to 130,000, about 80,000,
or three-fifths of the whole, reside within the limits of
the newly-constituted Province of Auckland; and that
of the European population of the Colony upwards of
one-third of the whole number are settled within a radius
of ten miles of the City of Auckland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That since the foundation of the Colony, nearly the
whole of the proceeds of the land sales paid into the
Colonial Treasury have arisen from the sale of lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
within the Province of Auckland, the proceeds of land
sales in other provinces having been paid to absentee
companies, and expended by them independently of any
control or audit on the part of the Colony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That during the last twelve months upwards of
£19,000 have been realised by the sale of Crown lands
in Auckland and its neighbourhood alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the shipping frequenting the ports of the Province
of Auckland exceeds the aggregate amount of the
shipping of the other five provinces into which New
Zealand is divided; and, without taking into consideration
the shipping resorting to the Bay of Islands,
Mongonui, Hokianga, and the other harbours of the
northern province, upwards of 740 vessels, foreign and
coastwise, entered the single port of Auckland in the
course of the past year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That of the shipping belonging to the various ports
of New Zealand, upwards of 100 vessels are registered
as belonging to the port of Auckland alone, besides an
equal number of licensed smaller vessels under fifteen
tons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That exports of the value of upwards of £78,000
were shipped from the port of Auckland alone during
the last year ended January, 1852.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the revenue arising within this province is
nearly equal to the revenue collected within the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of the provinces of Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury
and Otago; that of Auckland for the year ending
June 30, 1852, amounting to £35,318, and of the five
other provinces to £37,915.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, without reckoning the very extensive native
and other cultivations in various parts of the province,
there are, within fifteen miles of Auckland, upwards of
20,000 acres of land, substantially fenced, in high cultivation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, in addition to the various other valuable resources
of the province, gold in its natural state of
deposit has recently been discovered over an extensive
district within forty miles of the capital, on and near
the shores of a large, safe and commodious harbour,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and in other districts in an opposite direction, even much
nearer to the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the large native population of the province
are rapidly increasing in wealth, and advancing in the
arts and usages of civilised life; that they are producers
of the greater part of the wheat grown in the province;
the owners of a large number of mills, worked by water
power, and of numerous small vessels engaged in the
coasting trade, navigated by themselves, and employed
in carrying native produce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, in short, in shipping, commerce, agriculture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
revenue, population and wealth, the single Government
Province of Auckland nearly equals in all respects, and
surpasses in most, the aggregate of the numerous settlements
planted in New Zealand by the New Zealand Company
and the Canterbury Association, both of which
bodies have now altogether ceased their colonising operations,
if not wholly ceased to exist.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1851 there occurred an incident, which, ending
happily, might have had serious consequences.
The beginning of the affair was the apprehension
of a native named Ngawiki, of the Ngati-Tamatera
(Thames) by the police for the theft of a shirt.
An attempt was made by the chief of the Ngati-Paoa
and some others to rescue the criminal, and
a street row ensued, in the course of which a native
constable struck the chief with his staff several
blows on the head, and succeeded in holding the
prisoner. The <i>fracas</i> resulted in a native expedition
from Waiheke on April 17th against the town.
This force, which consisted of 250 armed men, was
led by a chief named Ngakapa. They landed at
Mechanics Bay, where they danced hakas and used
threatening language. With reinforcements, which
they expected, they hoped to number from 600 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
800 men. As the military and naval forces within
the capital did not amount to 400 men, the situation
looked serious, and Governor Sir George Grey
at once took steps to ward off the danger. He sent
a message by the Commissioner of Police (Captain
Beckham) to the natives, &ldquo;informing them that
they must either return to their homes within the
space of two hours, or give up their arms, and that
in the event of their non-compliance with these
terms measures would be taken to disarm them at
the expiration of the time specified.&rdquo; This ultimatum
proved effective, and the party retired to
Okahu (Orakei). There the war party met with
some reinforcements, but the failure of the invading
force, combined with the efforts of the Ngati-Whatua
chiefs of Orakei, who advised the newcomers
not to take part in the insurrection, resulted
in the reinforcements deciding not to participate
further in the affair. Instead, they ridiculed the
men who had taken part in the expedition &ldquo;for
having been compelled at low water to drag their
canoes over the extensive mud flats in the vicinity of
this town.&rdquo; The incident ended with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of regret by the principal chiefs of the war party,
and the voluntary surrender of their greenstone
meres to the Governor. The preparations for the defence
of the town were made by Lieutenant-Colonel
Wynyard, in co-operation with Captain Oliver,
commanding H.M.S. <i>Fly</i>. The pensioners in their
several villages placed themselves under arms. Sir
George Grey, in a special despatch, gives &ldquo;especial
credit to Major Kenny, of the first battalion of
pensioners, who arrived in Auckland with a reinforcement
of 200 pensioners in a shorter period
of time than I believed it possible for them to have
assembled and to have performed a march of about
six and a half miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pensioners mentioned above were a body of
time-expired regulars, who had been brought to
New Zealand, the pioneers of the force having arrived
in Auckland on August 5th, 1847, under the
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bolton, R.E., and
Captain Kenny, named in the above despatch.</p>

</div>

<p>The native constables who took part in this incident
did not long survive the event. It may, in fact,
come as a surprise to many that there ever were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
native policemen, and it may be interesting to
describe the appearance of these officers of the law.
Their attire was a semi-military, blue uniform,
resplendent with buttons, white facings and side
stripes. They carried substantial bludgeons, which,
as shown, they knew how to use, and did not scruple
to do so. Two of these defenders of the peace are
depicted in one of Hogan&rsquo;s <a href="#image015">views</a> (<i>f.</i> p. 77).</p>

<p>The discovery of gold at Coromandel, in 1852,
was an important event in the history of Auckland
and in the development of the resources of the
province. The gold finds in Victoria gave the impetus
to New Zealand, and prospecting parties
began to work. But it was not until a &ldquo;Reward
Committee&rdquo; was formed at Auckland, with Mr.
Frederick Whitaker as chairman, that any steps
were taken to prove the rumours that gold was
available in New Zealand. In October, 1852, a
reward of £500 was &ldquo;offered to the first person
who should discover and make known to the
&lsquo;Reward Committee&rsquo; &lsquo;a valuable gold find&rsquo; in the
northern district of New Zealand. Within less than
a week the reward was claimed by Mr. Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Ring, a New Zealand settler, recently returned
from California, who asserted that he had discovered
gold in the neighbourhood of Coromandel
Harbour.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Mr. Ring&rsquo;s claim was thereupon investigated,
and a sub-committee visited the locality
(Driving Creek). On their return, the committee
was able to announce that the sub-committee&rsquo;s report
&ldquo;is satisfactory, in so far as the existence of
gold is concerned, but that the question of its being
sufficiently abundant to be profitably worked is yet
in abeyance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As native rights were involved in
connection with the land, negotiations had to be
entered upon before the gold could be worked.
The Government therefore stepped in, and were
successful in their efforts with the natives, of
whom the chief was Taniwha, an old man, who in
his boyhood had met Captain Cook, and on November
30th an agreement was signed regulating the
management of the goldfield. On 11th December
the first sale of gold was held by Messrs. Connell
and Ridings, Auckland, and realised £32 1s. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
a short time a &lsquo;rush&rsquo; to Coromandel took place, and
about 3000 miners were at work on the diggings.
Between 1857 and 1860 a slump took place, but
a revival was experienced in 1861. During the
Maori war another slack period was felt, but after
hostilities had ceased, work was resumed, and has
continued ever since.</p>

<p>Although Coromandel never produced the gold
expected from it, it opened up a new industry,
which has grown to a considerable extent, and has
been the means of attracting population to the province,
and has indirectly affected the growth of
Auckland, the chief city of the province.</p>

<p>1853 stands forth a memorable year in the history
of New Zealand; for on the 17th January
Governor Grey proclaimed the Constitution Act
of 1852, passed by the Imperial Parliament, by
which the Dominion obtained representative institutions.
The Act provided for a General Assembly
for the whole Colony, consisting of a Legislative
Council and a House of Representatives. It also
abolished the Provinces of New Ulster and New
Munster, which had been set up under the Charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of 1847, and replaced them by six new provinces,
<i>viz</i>, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson,
Canterbury and Otago. The Councils were elective
and were presided over by a superintendent; they
had legislative powers within certain limits. The
Provincial Councils lasted until 1876, when they
were abolished by an Act of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The first session of the Auckland Provincial
Council, under the superintendence of Lieutenant-Colonel
Wynyard, was held on June 30th, 1853,
Mr. Thomas Houghton Bartley being appointed
Speaker. The maiden session of the Legislative
Council and the House of Representatives took
place simultaneously, on May 24th, 1854, the
Queen&rsquo;s Birthday, in the newly-erected Parliament
Building. As befitted the day and the occasion, the
ships in the harbour were decorated. At mid-day a
salute of twenty-one guns was fired at Fort Britomart,
and was followed by a <i>feu de joie</i> delivered
by the 58th Regiment in the square of Albert
Barracks. The Speaker of the Upper House was
Mr. William Swainson, and of the Representative
chamber, Mr. (<i>afterwards</i> Sir) Charles Clifford.</p>

New Zealand&rsquo;s First Parliament Building, Erected 1854<br />
The front portion (first gable) was the parliament building. It was afterwards extended and used by the Auckland University College.</p>
</div>

<p>It is outside the limits of this work to attempt
anything like a parliamentary history, but it may
be interesting to remark that the first Parliament
Building erected in New Zealand was situated at
the corner of Eden and Parliament Streets, and
that it served Parliament as a meeting place from
the beginning of its career until the removal of the
capital to Wellington. The building continued to
be used by the Provincial Council until the abolition
of the provinces, in 1876. It was afterwards
acquired by the Council of the Auckland University
College, by which body it was enlarged, and it
served its purpose in the educational work of the
city until 1918, when the buildings were taken over
by the City Council in connection with the proposed
new city outlet from Customs Street. Upon examination,
with a view to re-erecting this historic
building on another site, it was found that the
condition was so bad that demolition was the only
course. The city trams now run over the site of
New Zealand&rsquo;s first Parliament Building.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the prosperity which Auckland
and the Colony were experiencing at the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the &rsquo;sixties, there was serious trouble threatening
with the Maoris. The origin of the dispute,
which ended in warfare, was the land question,
some natives refusing to sell land to the settlers.
One result of this dissatisfaction between the
Maori and the pakeha was the conference, which
was held at Kohimarama in July and August,
1860. On the first day of the conference, 112
chiefs took their seats, and all the principal
tribes were represented, with the exception of
the Taranaki tribes, owing to the unsettled state
of that province. Prior to this conference, it had
been found necessary to make arrangements for
the defence of Auckland &ldquo;against any possible
contingency.&rdquo; In a despatch to the Duke of Newcastle,
the Governor, Sir Thomas Gore-Browne,
outlined the steps which he had taken with this
object in view. &ldquo;The town,&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;is divided
into five districts, each of which is to furnish a
company of militia. Those who have arms of their
own will form an inlying picket, and the remainder
will be required to ballot for such arms as the
Government is able to supply. At the present we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
can furnish sixty stand of arms to each company....
In addition to the militia, a volunteer force
of nearly 400 men, a mounted volunteer troop of
about 43 men, 110 [men] of the 65th Regiment
and 40 marines will form the garrison of the town.
Blockhouses, or houses rendered musket-proof,
will be established round the town ... and H.M.
frigate <i>Iris</i> is now anchored in the harbour. The
outer defences are as follow:&mdash;H.M. steam frigate
<i>Niger</i>, attended by a gunboat furnished by the local
government, is anchored in the Manukau. Lieutenant-Colonel
Kenny ... has been placed in
command of the settlement of Onehunga, and has
been directed to protect the Whau portage and
river.... At the portage itself a blockhouse is
in course of erection.... Lieutenant-Colonel
Nixon ... has been placed in command of the
pensioner settlement of Otahuhu, Panmure and
Howick, and has been directed to protect the line
of the Tamaki from the Waitemata to the Manukau.
A blockhouse is in course of erection on the
narrow neck of land leading to the village of Otahuhu.
Five hundred stand of arms ... have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
been supplied to this outpost and three hundred
to the outpost on the west....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Taranaki campaign, which arose out of the
dispute over the Waitara Block, lasted from March,
1860, to April, 1861. The trouble moved eastward,
the Waikato campaign breaking out in July, 1863,
and only ended with the magnificent defence by
the Maoris of Orakau on April 2, 1864. Finally
the war was concluded at Tauranga with the engagement
at Te Renga, and on October 25th a
proclamation of the Governor officially closed these
wars.</p>

<p>At no time did the scene of hostilities reach
the town of Auckland, but in July, 1863, Mr.
Meredith and his son were murdered in barbarous
fashion, and on October 26th of the same year
two sons of Mr. Trust were killed near Howick,
about fifteen miles from Auckland.</p>

<p>During the years 1863-64 the entire adult male
population of Auckland was enlisted for compulsory
service either in the militia, volunteers or fire
brigade, and had to undergo military training.
Some of the conscripts remained in the barracks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
both day and night, while others did duty at the
various blockhouses placed on points of vantage
overlooking the district. The blockhouses were
situated where the Auckland Hospital now stands,
and at Domain Hill, Parnell, Newmarket, Karangahape
Road, Great North Road, and Freeman&rsquo;s Bay.
The coast-line was also guarded. On July 22nd,
1863, the Auckland First Class Militia and Volunteers
joined the field force, and did duty on the
Wairoa River. In February, 1864, the Second
Class of Militia, comprising business and tradespeople,
were ordered on active service, and a contemporary
newspaper feared that, if the enlistments
continued, the shops of the town would have to
close and put up notices: &ldquo;Gone to the front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The electric telegraph was introduced into the
Auckland Province during the war of 1863, when
a line was erected under great difficulties between
the important military stations at Drury and Queen&rsquo;s
Redoubt. Covering parties were engaged to protect
the workers, who were also armed, in case of
emergencies. The first telegraph office erected in
Auckland was a wooden hut, located in the Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Barracks, just inside the barracks wall, Symonds
Street. This was the terminal of a single wire
which General Cameron had from his office to the
Otahuhu Military Camp near Anne&rsquo;s Bridge. The
first operator was Mr. Alex. Brodie, of the Royal
Engineers. About 1866, this office was removed to
the Post Office, Princes Street. By October, 1864,
there were 160 miles of telegraph lines in the province,
but communication with Wellington and the
South Island was not established until 1872. Four
years later Australia and Great Britain were
brought into telegraphic connection with New Zealand.</p>

<p>One of the happy results of the war in the Waikato
was the discovery of coal on the banks of the
Waikato River, in July, 1863, which was immediately
used on the river-boats engaged in the war.
After hostilities had ceased, the coal fields were
exploited, and the beginning of the successful coal-mining
industry at Huntly established. In March
of the following year coal was discovered at Kawakawa,
and from these sources were obtained supplies
for the domestic use of Auckland residents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and for the commercial needs of the town and province.</p>

<p>Another direct result of the war was the inauguration
of the railway system of the North Island,
although such a step would have taken place in
due course. The initial movement was made by the
Provincial Council in 1863, when a report was
adopted recommending the construction of a railway
between Auckland and Drury, with a branch
line to Onehunga. Tenders were accordingly invited
in the following year, the offer of Messrs.
Brogden and Sons, an English firm, being accepted.
The work commenced on 17th February, 1865.
Parnell Hill was pierced by a tunnel on July 31st,
1872, and the Auckland-Onehunga portion of the
line was opened on December 24th, 1873. The
Auckland station was then situated on the harbour
at the eastern side of Point Britomart, near the
end of Custom-House Street [now Customs Street].
The growth of the railway system of the province
was slow, and by the end of 1877 only 93 miles
had been completed. With the demolition of Point
Britomart the railway station was removed to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
present location, being completed on October 26th,
1885. It would be interesting to trace step by step
the extension of the railway system, as, obviously,
it is part of the history of Auckland, but, in so
brief a sketch as this, detail is impossible. It is
worth mentioning, however, that the first Main
Trunk train from Wellington to Auckland arrived
on November 6th, 1908, and that the daily express
between here and the capital was inaugurated on
February 14th, 1909.</p>

<p>Travelling overland prior to the introduction of
railways, and for many years after, was conducted
by coaches. In the earliest days this means of locomotion
was restricted, but increased with the opening
up of the province and the development of the
roads. Thus, in 1867, there was established a daily
service of coaches to Hamilton. The coaches were
of the type known as &ldquo;Cobb &amp; Co.&rdquo;, an exceedingly
picturesque vehicle, with dickys for the driver
and for passengers at the rear. The most extensive
and famous line of coaches were those owned by
Messrs. Quick Bros.</p>

<p>The city and suburban conveyances were at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
busses, and, later, horse-drawn Albert cars. As
early as 1864 there was a half-hourly service of
busses to Onehunga.</p>

<p>Early in the &rsquo;sixties a regular service of communication
was inaugurated with the North Shore,
which has been maintained and developed until
the present time. The first name associated with
this service is Mr. A. Alison, the present manager
of the Devonport Steam Ferry Company, who, in
1861, inaugurated a ferry in open boats, making
two trips a day, which obtained until superseded by
a three-trip service introduced by Messrs. Holmes
Bros., who owned the hotel at Devonport, and subsequently
formed a company to run the steamer
<i>Waitemata</i> in 1864. The following year the <i>Enterprise</i>
was launched. This boat, small in size as
compared with a modern ferry, was capable of
carrying 200 passengers, and had accommodation
in her two saloons for fifty persons. She did the
trip from Auckland to the Shore in twenty minutes,
and kept up a regular service between 7.30 a.m.
and 8 p.m. The earlier boat, <i>Waitemata</i>, was enlarged
by having her bow and stern cut off and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
replaced, and was then put into commission as
<i>Enterprise No. 2</i>. Soon afterwards she was sold
to a Thames company for work in connection with
the gold discovery. Holmes Bros., in turn, met with
opposition from a company styled the Auckland
and North Shore Ferry Company, which built and
ran the <i>Takapuna</i> and other boats, ousting them
and acquiring their plant. There were also other
rivals, who did not, however, last long. In 1881,
Messrs. Quick and Alison formed an opposition
company, and commenced building the <i>Victoria</i>.
They also invited tenders for a second vessel, but
before the tenders were received the Auckland and
North Shore Company sold out. Messrs. Alison
and Quick did not remain long in partnership, and
in the same year the Devonport Steam Ferry Company
was formed, and has carried on the ferry services
ever since, which now include practically all
parts of the harbour.</p>

<p>The effects of the war were felt in Auckland in
various ways. At first there was confusion and
consternation among the inhabitants, which feelings
were allayed by the arrival of troops and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
passing of the danger of invasion. Notwithstanding
the business and commerce of the city continued
to increase. At the conclusion of the war a
reaction set in, and distress through unemployment
became acute, especially among newly-arrived
immigrants. The population of the city
at the census taken in December, 1861, was 7989
persons, and three years later had grown to 12,423,
a very large increase in so short a time. The rush
to the Otago goldfields, however, began to draw
numbers of the population south, and the removal
of the seat of Government, in 1865, was responsible
for the loss of the Government officers and
civil servants. During the two following years,
1866 and 1867, most of the Imperial regiments
which had taken part in the Maori wars returned
to England, taking with them their wives and
families, further reducing the population. The
last of the troops to leave Auckland was the 18th
(Royal Irish) Regiment, which departed at the
beginning of 1870. The survivors of this regiment
hold a reunion annually in Auckland on July 4th,
the anniversary of their arrival in New Zealand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
By 1867 the inhabitants had decreased to 11,153.
Auckland was passing through a bad period, while
its rival on the Cook Straits, and Dunedin and
Christchurch were progressing rapidly.</p>

<p>The record of the banks which opened business
in this period shows clearly the progress which the
city was making. In 1861 two new banks began
operations. The Bank of New South Wales was
opened in Shortland Street on 11th June, and continued
to carry on the business of the branch of the
Oriental Bank Corporation, which had been established
in the city some years previously. On February
21st, 1884, the building in Queen Street was
opened, where the business is still carried on. The
architects were Messrs. Armson, Collins and Lloyd,
of Christchurch, and the contractor Mr. Philcox, of
Auckland. The building cost £11,500. The Bank
of New Zealand, an entirely local concern, commenced
business on 16th October. A contemporary
newspaper emphasised this aspect, and stated that
the business was being conducted &ldquo;with colonial
capital, with colonial shareholders ... and with
colonial customers in every city and province of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
New Zealand vitally interested in its success.&rdquo; The
initial capital was £500,000. Mr. A. Kennedy,
formerly manager of the New Zealand Banking
Company and of the Union Bank of Australia,
was its first manager. The original premises were
in Queen Street, near Durham Street East, formerly
occupied by T. S. Forsaith. The building now used
was opened towards the end of 1867, and ranks
as one of the finest examples of architecture in the
city. The architect was Mr. Leonard Terry, of Melbourne,
and the builder was Mr. R. Dickson. Mr.
Richard Keals was supervising architect. The first
twenty-five years of the bank&rsquo;s history were years
of prosperity. A strained situation was revealed in
1887, and for the next seven years the bank underwent
a series of reverses, ending in the loss of the
whole of the capital and reserves and one-third of
the reserve liability. In 1894 the Government came
to the rescue of the bank, and since then its progress
has been well maintained, and it now occupies
an assured position. The head office is now in Wellington;
there is, of course, a London office, and,
in addition to branches everywhere in New Zea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>land,
there are offices in Australia, Fiji and Samoa.
Three years later, 1864, two other banks made their
advent. One of them, the Bank of Auckland, was another
local undertaking, which did not meet with the
success that the Bank of New Zealand was to experience.
It was opened for business in the premises
formerly occupied by the Union Bank in Shortland
Street, but collapsed at the end of March, 1867.
The other was an Australian company, the Bank of
Australasia, which opened its head branch in New
Zealand here, occupying premises in Shortland
Street adjoining the Post Office. Later it removed
to Queen Street, where it still carries on business.</p>

<p>Another indication of the growing business prosperity
of Auckland was shown in the establishment
of the New Zealand Fire and Marine Insurance
Company, which came into existence on May
26th, 1859, as the result of the enterprise of some
of Auckland&rsquo;s leading business men. The original
capital was £100,000, which was guaranteed by
the first shareholders, in sums of from £2000 to
£5000. To detail the history of this concern, which
has grown to world-wide dimensions, would neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>sitate
more space than could be afforded; but it
is worth relating that its first office was located at
the corner of Shortland and Queen Streets in premises
known as Fraser&rsquo;s Buildings. From 1871 till
1915 the business of the company was carried on
in a two-storeyed building, over which was erected
a clock tower, which became quite a feature of
Queen Street. In the latter year this building was
demolished, and upon its site was erected the
present handsome edifice of seven storeys. Mr.
W. H. Gummer, A.R.I.B.A., was the architect, and
Messrs. Grevatt and Sons the contractors. The
building cost £110,000.</p>

<p>The shipbuilding industry of Auckland appears
to have commenced somewhere in the late &rsquo;forties,
but the records of this interesting subject are either
negligible or non-existent. Amongst the earliest
boatbuilders mention must be made of Messrs.
Henry Niccol, Holmes Bros., Alex. Duthie, Wm.
J. Brown, Captain McCoy, and Mr. Stone, whose
yards seem to have been kept busy. To the latter
belongs the credit of building the first steamboat
in New Zealand, which was launched at Freeman&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Bay on December 24th, 1851. She was named
(contrary to her sex) <i>Governor Wynyard</i>. Her
dimensions were as follows: Length over all,
60 feet; beam, 13 feet 6 inches; depth of hold,
6 feet; burthen, 43 tons; draught of water with
engines and fuel, 2 feet 6 inches. She was propelled
by two steeple engines of 4 horse-power
each. The designers were Messrs. Stone and Gardiner,
the engine being constructed by Mr. Bourne.
The steamer made her first trip to Panmure on
January 19th, 1852, in very trying weather, and
acquitted herself satisfactorily to all concerned.
She developed a speed of eight knots. From a
commercial point of view the boat was not a success,
and was sold later in that year to a Melbourne
firm. On the Yarra she proved a great &ldquo;moneymaker,&rdquo;
as she earned as much as £80 in a day.</p>

</div>

<p>At what date Mr. Niccol commenced his business
the writer has not been able to find out, but
he was engaged on shipbuilding in the &rsquo;fifties,
during which period he built a vessel named the
<i>Moa</i>. He also constructed a number of vessels for
Australian owners and for the proprietors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Circular Saw Line. One of the boats belonging
to the latter, of which we have knowledge, was
the barque <i>Novelty</i>, which was launched from
Mr. Niccol&rsquo;s yard, Mechanics Bay, on 11th October,
1862. She was the largest vessel built in Auckland
up to that time&mdash;a record which still holds
in local shipbuilding, as far as the writer&rsquo;s knowledge
obtains. Her dimensions were: Length over
all, 147 feet; beam, 27 feet 6 inches; depth of
hold, 14 feet 9 inches; registered tonnage, 376
tons. The christening of the vessel was performed
by Miss Macfarlane, daughter of one of the owners,
in traditional fashion, and the event, as befitted
its importance, was celebrated by a banquet. The
<i>Novelty</i> was a well-designed and faithfully-built
vessel, and did good service for her owners. She
did the voyage from Auckland to Sydney in five
days.</p>

<p>No sketch of Auckland&rsquo;s shipping history would
be complete without some reference, however brief,
to the Circular Saw Line, which was established by
Messrs. Henderson and Macfarlane, two of Auckland&rsquo;s
pioneers. Mr. Henderson arrived in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Zealand in 1842, and some years later he was
joined by Mr. Macfarlane. About 1846 they established
a timber business at Henderson, and later
erected a mill there. Among the places to which
they exported kauri was Mauritius, the vessels
which took the timber returning with cargoes of
sugar. It may have been this enterprise which
encouraged them to establish the fleet some time
in the &rsquo;fifties. Commencing with the brig <i>Spenser</i>,
Mr. Henderson made the first trip to Melbourne.
While there he purchased the schooner <i>Will o&rsquo; the
Wisp</i>, and established the inter-colonial trade. The
brigs (of which class of vessel he owned six) and
barques (of which no fewer than fifteen flew the
flag of this line) were employed in the inter-colonial
and &rsquo;Frisco services. The schooners, numbering
fourteen, did the Island trade. Before the dissolution
of the line in 1875, four steamers were
added to the fleet, which were bought from the
Panama Company. These vessels were placed in
the New Zealand coastal service, plying from Onehunga.</p>

<p>In the &rsquo;fifties and &rsquo;sixties there were a num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ber
of cutters and schooners, owned and manned
by Maoris, which traded between Auckland and
various ports on the East Coast, sailing as far south
as the Bay of Plenty. White traders also participated
in the coastal trade, amongst whom was Mr.
H. J. Wadham, stevedore, of Auckland, who owned
a number of fine vessels, drawings of which have
recently been presented to the Old Colonists&rsquo; Museum.</p>

<p>During the first two or three decades of the port&rsquo;s
history, most of the shipping was by sail, and as
the movements of these sailers were erratic, a continuous
record is a rather difficult matter. With the
advent of steam in the &rsquo;fifties, and its development
in the following years, a more satisfactory account
is possible.</p>

<p>Besides the Circular Saw Line we have records
of other ships.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The <i>Wonga Wonga</i>, a steamer of
67 tons, was owned by a number of Auckland merchants,
who placed the vessel on the Whangarei
service in 1857. After a few months running she
was sold to the Wellington Steamship Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and placed in the Wellington-Nelson service;
later, during the Taranaki war, she was chartered
at £60 a day to carry despatches between Onehunga
and Taranaki. Her career ended on 22nd May,
1866, when she was wrecked off Greymouth. Early
in the &rsquo;sixties the <i>Rangatira</i> arrived in Auckland,
having been built at Home for local owners.
Shortly afterwards the steamers <i>Corio</i> and <i>Ahuriri</i>
entered the Auckland-Napier trade. In 1864 services
were opened to Coromandel, North Auckland,
and the Waikato (<i>via</i> Onehunga). Altogether,
there were in 1868 fourteen steamers trading from
Auckland. The opening of the Thames goldfield
in 1867 gave an impetus to the trade of the port,
and Mr. S. Hague Smith placed a number of
steamers on this run, including the <i>Duke of Edinburgh</i>
(Captain W. Farquhar) and <i>Royal Albert</i>
(Captain Alex. Farquhar), the latter vessel having
been built at Niccol&rsquo;s yard, North Shore, her engines
being taken from the <i>Prince Alfred</i>, and her
boiler manufactured at Sydney, from plans prepared
by Mr. James Stewart, of Auckland, civil
engineer. Other boats engaged on this service were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the <i>Favourite</i>, the <i>Williams</i> (218 tons), and the
<i>Golden Crown</i>. In 1873 Mr. Smith sold his fleet
to the Auckland Steam Packet Company.</p>

<p>The first regular inter-colonial service between
New South Wales and New Zealand was inaugurated
by the <i>William Denny</i> (595 tons), in 1854.
She was wrecked at North Cape, March 3rd, 1857.
In 1859 the Inter-Colonial Royal Mail Steamship
Company took up the Australian run, the <i>Prince
Alfred</i> (1100 tons) being one of the fleet engaged.
This company maintained the service until 1866,
when the Panama, New Zealand and Australian
Line superseded it, absorbing its fleet. The object
of the new company, which held a monopoly
of the mails, was to connect Australia and New
Zealand with the continent of Europe, <i>via</i> Panama.
A rearrangement of the inter-colonial service was
made, so as to connect with the trans-Pacific steamers.
This arrangement lasted till 1869. The year
following a temporary service between Sydney and
San Francisco was inaugurated, Auckland being
the port of call, the following ships being engaged
in it, <i>viz</i>, <i>Rangatira</i> and <i>Balclutha</i>, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
soon replaced by the <i>City of Melbourne</i> and <i>Wonga
Wonga</i>.</p>

<p>The year 1854 also saw the establishment of a
regular inter-provincial steamer service. The <i>Nelson</i>
(330 tons, Captain Martin) was the pioneer
vessel, Dunedin and Onehunga being the terminal
ports, and New Plymouth, Nelson, Wellington and
Lyttelton ports of call. In 1855 the <i>Zingari</i> (150
tons, Captain Milltown) replaced the <i>Nelson</i>. Other
steamers engaged during this period on the coastal
routes were the <i>Claud Hamilton</i> and the <i>White
Swan</i>, which was wrecked on June 29th, 1862, a
number of public records belonging to the Government
being lost.</p>

<p>The Inter-Colonial R.M.S. Company met with
opposition in the coastal service from the New
Zealand Steam Navigation Company, which had
been formed upon the liquidation of the Wellington
Steamship Company, in 1863, the following
steamers being used in the running of the service,
<i>viz</i>, <i>Stormbird</i>, <i>Wellington</i> and <i>Queen</i>.</p>

<p>Another line which traded between Dunedin and
Auckland was the Adelaide, Melbourne and Otago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
S.N. Company, which placed the <i>Alhambra</i> (642
tons) and <i>Aldinga</i> (446 tons) on this run.</p>

<p>The wreck of H.M.S. <i>Orpheus</i> on the Manukau
Bar on February 7th, 1863, was the most appalling
disaster associated with Auckland&rsquo;s shipping
annals. The <i>Orpheus</i> (Commodore W. F. Burnett)
was a corvette of 1706 tons, which had been detailed
for service on the New Zealand station. She
sailed from Sydney on January 31st, and reached
the Manukau Heads on 7th February. In attempting
to cross the bar the vessel &ldquo;struck hard, and
orders were given to back astern full speed. The
engines never moved; the ship fell off broadside
to the rollers, the sea knocking away her stern post,
port bulwarks and boats, and making a clean sweep
over all.&rdquo; A cutter containing the ship&rsquo;s records,
and a pinnace got safely away. After the pinnace
had left the ship, &ldquo;the launch was got over the side
with forty men to lay out anchors, in the hope of
making grapplings to haul into smooth water. The
ebb-tide, unhappily, swept her under the bows,
where she was stove, and nearly all on board
drowned.&rdquo; The pinnace, however, was able to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
into touch with the steamer <i>Wonga Wonga</i>, and
later with H.M.S. <i>Harrier</i>, and the few survivors
from the wreck were picked up by the former
vessel. About 6.30 p.m. the masts went, and the
ship parted in halves. A contemporary account of
the disaster states that the officers and men underwent
the terrible ordeal in heroic fashion, and
&ldquo;when the masts went the crew gave three cheers,
as if taking farewell of life.&rdquo; Out of a ship&rsquo;s
company of 256 officers, seamen, boys and marines,
only 71 survived. The remains of some of
the crew, including the commodore, which were
washed ashore, were interred in Symonds Street
cemetery. The disaster created consternation in the
city, and a day of mourning was observed in memory
of those who lost their lives.</p>

<p>Auckland buildings of the &rsquo;fifties and &rsquo;sixties
were, with few exceptions, constructed of wood,
and fires were of constant occurrence. In those
days, fire-fighting appliances were of a most
elementary character, consisting of buckets, and,
later, of reels and what would now be considered
very primitive fire engines. There was a volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
fire brigade, and water could only be procured
from wells or from the sea. Under such circumstances,
it is not surprising that fires were common
events; indeed, had the town been completely
wiped out by fire it would not have been too
great a surprise, considering the conditions. What
is remarkable is that no fatalities attended the
outbreaks.</p>

<p>The most serious fire which had occurred up to
this time was that which broke out at two o&rsquo;clock
on the morning of the 7th of July, 1858. It originated
at the Osprey Inn, High Street, and, fanned
by a strong north-easterly gale, the fire soon covered
an area bounded by Chancery, High, Shortland
and O&rsquo;Connell Streets. But for a providential
change in the direction of the wind and the coming
of rain, which soaked the adjacent buildings, the
fire might have caused even greater damage. As
it was the conflagration was only arrested in Shortland
Street by the voluntary blowing up of Mr.
Keesing&rsquo;s house, thus making a gap in the direction
the fire was taking. Before dawn the flames had
consumed fifty houses, mostly belonging to trades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>people,
rendering their plight deplorable. So rapid
was the progress of the fire that the inhabitants
had merely time to save themselves, in many cases
clothed only in night attire. Although the damage
was so considerable, the Volunteer Fire Brigade
and the officers and men of the 58th Regiment
earned credit for their expeditious and willing
help. The fire-fighters carried out their work
wrapped in blankets, over which water was constantly
poured to save them from the heat of the
flames.</p>

<p>The second large fire experienced in Auckland
took place in the early hours of January 17th,
1863. Commencing in the premises occupied by
Messrs. Morrin &amp; Co., at the corner of Queen Street
and Durham Street East, it spread rapidly, and
soon stretched to Victoria Street and High Street.
In its course it destroyed the Thistle Hotel, the
Greyhound, Y.M.C.A., the old theatre, and other
buildings. It even threatened the buildings on the
opposite sides of Queen and High Streets. The
Volunteer Fire Brigade was assisted by military
from the barracks, and the sailors from the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
warship <i>Bonite</i> earned well-deserved credit for
their services and daring deeds. Fortunately, a
light wind was blowing, or the losses, which were
serious enough&mdash;amounting, it was estimated, to
£60,000&mdash;would have been greater. Many of the
sufferers by the fire were succoured and accommodated
in the barracks for a time.</p>

<p>Two years later (January 18th, 1865) another
big fire broke out in Queen Street, in premises
occupied by Mr. J. S. Macfarlane, known as Henderson
and Macfarlane&rsquo;s Buildings. Luckily, the
outbreak was confined to the two upper storeys,
which were, however, completely gutted. The fire
was both brilliant and spectacular, and attracted
enormous crowds, which had to be kept back from
the building by soldiers with fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>Queen Street was again the scene of a fire
which fills the annals of 1866. This conflagration
commenced about 10 p.m. on August 28th in Lower
Queen Street, on the western side, almost on the
waterfront, and in less than fifteen minutes from
the alarm being given twelve buildings were in
flames. The fire was noticed first in the premises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
occupied by Messrs. Malcolm, sail makers, but so
swift was its progress that in the short period mentioned
it had obtained a hold of so many buildings.
The flames ignited the buildings on the eastern side
of Queen Street, but this incipient outbreak was
rapidly suppressed. The damage was estimated at
£20,000. The newspapers of the time give praise
to the Volunteer Fire Brigade, whose engines and
equipment had become improved.</p>

<p>On 31st March of the same year a gale, accompanied
by heavy rains, which caused floods, did a
very great amount of damage, estimated also at
£20,000. It was the severest gale which the town
of Auckland had experienced. Nine vessels and a
coal hulk were sunk in the harbour, and many
others were severely damaged, or caused injury
to the wharves. The heavy seas which broke on
the waterfront destroyed property, particularly at
Mr. Stone&rsquo;s shipbuilding yard at the Strand. The
town suffered from the rain, which, gaining entrance
to stores and cellars, damaged merchandise
and stores.</p>

<p>On April 15th, 1865, lighting by gas was intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>duced
into Auckland. It was an event of great
importance to the citizens of the time. The <i>New
Zealand Herald</i> describes how the innovation was
received:&mdash;&ldquo;A large proportion of the city population
had assembled in the streets to welcome the
advent of the &lsquo;New Light,&rsquo; and the <i>début</i> of the
much-longed-for novelty may be considered to have
been quite as <i>brilliant</i> as that of any star that has
appeared among us for a long time. In fact, Queen
Street was thronged until an advanced hour of the
evening with moving crowds of gazers, who seemed
never to weary of staring at the unwonted spectacle
presented to them, while there were occasional
&lsquo;rushes&rsquo; into some of the other streets, as the report
spread of some particularly effective illumination
or of some establishment whose meter had come
to grief, and left it in sudden and ignoble obscurity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previous to the introduction of gas for lighting,
oil and candles had been used. In the Old Colonists&rsquo;
Museum there may be seen an apparatus for
making candles. Every household had one of these.</p>

<p>The first Royal visit to Auckland took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in 1869, when Prince Alfred, the second son of
Queen Victoria, better known as the Duke of
Edinburgh, arrived in the Waitemata, on May 8th,
on board H.M.S. <i>Galatea</i>. He was even more
popularly known as the Sailor Prince. The <i>Galatea</i>
was the largest ship which had visited the harbour,
her tonnage being 3227 tons. She employed both sail
and steam. The visit naturally created excitement
amongst the population of the city and district. As
became the occasion, the city was beflagged and
decorated with bunting, greenery, triumphal arches,
and with illuminations known as transparencies.
The harbour, too, presented a picturesque appearance.
The fleet in port numbered 92 vessels, totalling
9252 tons, exclusive of H.M.Ss. <i>Challenger</i>, <i>Galatea</i>
and <i>Virago</i>, and small sailing craft. All were
gaily decorated.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 10th, the official landing took
place. Military detachments, both regulars and
volunteers, were present from various parts of the
province and from the city. Conspicuous among
the people congregated on the wharf were a large
number of Maoris from the West Coast, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
assisted the Imperial troops in the recent wars.
The 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment, with its band,
formed the guard of honour.</p>

<p>Owing to a disturbing wind, a marine demonstration
which had been projected was abandoned.
The weather, however, did not deter the Maoris,
in native costume, from embarking in their canoes
and welcoming the Duke in traditional fashion.</p>

<p>A Royal salute of twenty-one guns announced the
departure of His Royal Highness from the <i>Galatea</i>,
and in a short time he reached the wharf,
where he was welcomed to Auckland by the Governor,
Sir George Ferguson Bowen, who was attended
by the naval and military officers, members
of Parliament, officials, the clergy, citizens, and
natives. An address of welcome was read by Mr.
John Williamson, Superintendent, on behalf of the
Province of Auckland, which was followed by an
address of welcome by the Chief Paul on behalf of
the natives. As the Duke walked along the wharf,
a contingent of between 500 and 600 Maoris
danced a haka in honour of the Royal visitor.</p>

<p>At Custom-House Street the City Commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
presented, through their chairman, an address of
welcome on behalf of the citizens. The formalities
having been thus observed, a procession was
formed, and the distinguished visitor drove through
streets gaily decorated, to receive a popular welcome.
At Government House, where the cavalcade
came to its destination, members of friendly societies
and other organisations were drawn up to
welcome the Prince. Here, also, some 1500 school
children sang the National Anthem. Later in the
day a <i>levée</i> was held.</p>

<p>Only one incident occurred to mar the rejoicings.
During the firing of the salute on the <i>Galatea</i> a
sailor was blown overboard. Sub-lieutenant O&rsquo;Connor
jumped into the water and rescued the unfortunate
man, who was found to have had his right
arm so injured as to necessitate amputation. His
left hand was entirely blown away, except one
finger.</p>

<p>The Duke remained in Auckland until June 1st,
delaying his departure in the hope of being able
to assist in settling the native trouble. However,
he had to leave without any result accruing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
his well-intentioned purpose. He was <i>fêted</i> in the
usual way, but the most important public function
with which his name is connected was the opening
of the Auckland Grammar School.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Auckland Grammar School, which was a
most unpretentious affair, was opened by the Duke
of Edinburgh on May 17th, 1869. The building,
which was situated in Howe Street, off Karangahape
Road, had been used as an Emigrants&rsquo; Home.
The staff consisted of the Head Master, the Rev.
Robert Kidd, B.A., LL.D., and five other masters.
On May 1st, 1871 the school was transferred to
the Albert Barracks, into the building subsequently
used as Police Barracks. At this transfer Mr.
Farquhar Macrae became Head Master, with Dr.
Kidd as Classical Master, the total staff being increased
to nine. Here the school remained till
June, 1878. On July 8th of this year the school
was removed to the District Court, Eden Street,
now demolished, but the building proved inadequate,
and extra accommodation had to be found
in an old Maori Chapel in Parliament Street, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in St. Andrew&rsquo;s School, Symonds Street. During
Sir George Grey&rsquo;s premiership a grant of £5000
was made for erecting a new building, which was
supplemented by £3000 from Grammar School
funds. With these combined sums the Symonds
Street building was erected in 1879, and was
opened by Sir George Grey on 5th February,
1880. In 1882 Mr. C. F. Bourne succeeded Mr.
Macrae as Head Master, which position he held
until 1892. The following year the present Head
Master of the school, Mr. James William Tibbs,
M.A., was appointed. In 1888 the Girls&rsquo; College,
founded by Mr. Neil Heath, and carried on by
him for some years in the old Wesley College,
Queen Street, was united to the Grammar School,
and the girls were transferred to the Symonds
Street building. Here the girls remained under
Mr. Tibbs until 1906, when the Board of Governors
decided to place them under a Head Mistress,
and to erect a building for their sole use. Miss
Whitelaw was appointed to the position, and on
April 8th, 1909, the new school in Howe Street,
known as the Girls&rsquo; Grammar School, was opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
by the Hon. George Fowlds, Minister of Education.
Miss Whitelaw retired from the Head Mistressship
in 1910, and was succeeded by Miss Butler in
the following year. Miss Butler held the position
until 1920. Miss Picken is the present Head
Mistress. The increase in the number of students
attending the school was so large that another
school was opened at Epsom in 1917. Miss Morrison
is in charge of this school.</p>

<p>The Boys&rsquo; Grammar School also continued to
increase, and about 1910 steps were taken to obtain
a larger site and a modern building. In 1915 the
Government granted a site occupying 15 acres in
Mountain Road, on which the present building was
erected. It was officially opened on 26th April,
1916, by the Governor, the Earl of Liverpool. In
addition to class rooms, etc., designed to accommodate
about 800 boys, it has ample playing
grounds. Messrs. Arnold and Abbott were the
architects, and Mr. W. E. Hutchison the contractor
for the building, which cost £31,450 to erect.
Although only five years have elapsed since the
opening of the new school, the accommodation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
inadequate for the number of boys desiring secondary
education, and a new school is under construction
at Mount Albert to meet the demand.</p>

<p>Another institution of an educational character
began its career in this period. This was the Auckland
Museum, which was opened on October 24th,
1852, in a small four-roomed cottage in Grafton
Road. Dr. Andrew Sinclair was the moving spirit
in the young museum, and upon his death its
activity languished. In 1859 Dr. Hochstetter renovated
the collection, but it again fell into neglect.
Captain F. W. Hutton resuscitated the museum, and
under his supervision it was removed, in 1867,
to the Provincial Government Offices (where the
Northern Club now stands). The following year
it was amalgamated with the Auckland Institute,
which had been established in 1867. Through the
influence of Mr. Justice Gillies a site at the corner
of Princes Street and Eden Crescent, with the buildings
which had been used as a Post Office, was
secured, and to these inadequate premises the collection
was removed. In 1876 the present building
was opened. The increase of the collection has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
rendered this building unequal to the development
of the museum, and a new building, which will
combine the purpose of a War Memorial and
Museum, is to be erected in the Domain.</p>

<p>Church development was a feature of this period.
St. Matthew&rsquo;s Church was constituted a parish in
1853, the school which stood on the site of the
present church being used for the purpose. Later
a wooden building was erected, which was superseded
in 1905, when the new church was opened
on March 7th of that year. This building, which
occupies one of the most commanding positions in
the city, was designed by Mr. F. L. Pearson,
F.R.I.B.A., and cost £27,000 to erect. The foundation
stone was laid on the 23rd of April, 1902,
with full Masonic honours. Messrs. Malcolm and
Ferguson were the contractors, and Mr. E. Bartley
supervising architect. The stone used in the construction
came from the Oamaru and Mount Somers
quarries. The principal dimensions are: length,
151 feet; width (transept), 100 feet; height from
floor to ceiling, 70 feet; height of tower, 147 feet.</p>

<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s pro-Cathedral, Parnell, was dedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>cated
by Bishop Selwyn on October 14th, 1860,
Archdeacon G. S. Kissling being the first incumbent.
The foundation stone of the present building
was laid by the Primate (Bishop Harper) on February
6th, 1886. The building was not completed
until 1898, when it was dedicated by Bishop Cowie,
Archdeacon Macmurray being the vicar. The
church was designed by Mr. B. W. Mountfoot, and
was built by Mr. R. R. Ross.</p>

<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was established
in 1865 in a temporary building on land
adjoining the Auckland cemetery. In 1881 the
present building in Khyber Pass Road was opened,
on 29th June, by Bishop Cowie. It cost over £5000.
Messrs. Mahoney and Sons were the architects, and
Mr. James the contractor.</p>

<p>All Saints, Ponsonby, was opened on December
21st, 1866, by Bishop Selwyn, who was responsible
for the services for some time afterwards.
The building has been enlarged since the original
structure was erected.</p>

<p>After the erection of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, no
additions to the Roman Catholic churches were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
made until 1866, when Bishop Pompallier built
the Church of S. Francis de Sales in the cemetery,
near the corner of Symonds and East Streets. This
old church was replaced by St. Benedinct&rsquo;s Church,
which was opened on July 23, 1882, Dr. Redwood,
Bishop of Wellington, officiating at the consecration.
The building, which was constructed of kauri,
was built by Mr. T. Colebrook, from the plans of
Messrs. Mahoney and Sons, and cost over £6000.
It was destroyed by fire on 18th December, 1886.
In a little over a year the present brick church
was completed, and was opened by Bishop Luck,
in the presence of Dr. Redwood, on 22nd April,
1888. Messrs. Mahoney and Sons were again the
architects, and Mr. J. J. Holland the builder. The
interior decorations in both buildings were the
work of Father Luck. The cost of the land upon
which the church is built was £1150, and the building,
excluding furniture, £5950.</p>

<p>For ten years after the opening of St. Andrew&rsquo;s,
the Presbyterians did not add to their number of
churches. The first outgrowth of St. Andrew&rsquo;s was
St. James&rsquo;s, Wellington Street, which was erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to a charge in 1860, the services being carried on
in the school house. The present building was
opened on March 26th, 1865. It was designed by
Mr. T. B. Cameron, and was built by Mr. Andrew
Clow, the contract price being £2500.</p>

<p>St. David&rsquo;s Church has had an interesting history.
In 1864 the session of St. Andrew&rsquo;s erected
a preaching station at the junction of Khyber Pass
Road and Symonds Street, and named it St. David&rsquo;s
Church. Rev. James Wallis was the first minister,
and under his care the church flourished until
1867, when a division arose in the congregation,
leading to its abandonment. After a lapse of ten
years it was re-established and re-opened on 10th
March, 1878. Shortly afterwards St. David&rsquo;s was
elevated to a session. In 1880 the present church
was erected in Symonds Street, in the allotment
at the front of the old building, by Mr. James
Heron, from the plans of Mr. E. Bartley. It was
removed to its present location in 1902.</p>

<p>The first Baptist Church in Auckland was formed
in 1855. A chapel and schoolroom were erected
in Wellesley Street at the corner of Chapel Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
About 1880 Mr. Thomas Spurgeon, a son of the
famous evangelical preacher, became pastor. The
congregation had now grown to such dimensions
that the Choral Hall was requisitioned for the Sunday
evening service, and proved too small. It was
thereupon decided to build the Tabernacle. This
building was opened on May 12th, 1885. The
building, which is Corinthian in style, was designed
by Mr. Edmund Bell, the contractor being Mr. J.
J. Holland. It cost £14,000, including furnishings.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan denomination erected two churches
during this period, one in Pitt Street, the other in
Grafton Road. The former was opened for worship
on the 4th of October, 1866. Wesley Hall, adjoining
the church, was erected in 1877, and is used
as a schoolroom. Including the parsonage, the
buildings belonging to this church cost £20,000
to erect. The Grafton Road Church was erected
in 1866, and was replaced by a new building, which
was dedicated to public worship in July, 1885.
The Helping Hand Mission was instituted in the
early &rsquo;eighties, and in 1885 the hall in Drake Street
was opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The Congregational Church was founded in
1851, and the first church was situated in High
Street, and existed till 1876. The premier church,
however, is Beresford Street Church, which was
established in March of the following year, the
services being held in Shamrock Cottage, Albert
Street. A church was erected close to this cottage
in 1854, and was called the Albert Street Congregational
Church. The present church was erected
in 1876, and is reputed to be the first concrete
building erected in Auckland. The Newton Church,
Edinburgh Street, was founded in 1864.</p>

<p>The first Primitive Methodist Church was built
in Alexandra Street in 1851, on a site given by
Governor Sir George Grey. Prior to union with
the Wesleyan denomination there were two circuits
in connection with this Church, of which the
Alexandra Street Church was the chief centre; the
other centre was the Franklin Road Church. Upon
the union taking place the Church became The
Methodist Church of New Zealand.</p>

<p>The Jewish community opened its first church
in Emily Place in 1858. Rabbi Elkin was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
first minister. He was succeeded in 1881 by the
present minister, Rabbi Goldstein. The Synagogue
in Princes Street was opened in 1885.</p>

<p>The Auckland Y.M.C.A. was founded by Mr.
R. B. Shalders, and its first building&mdash;a mere four
walls&mdash;was erected in the founder&rsquo;s garden, Chapel
Street, in 1855. Next year the association procured
larger premises in Durham Street, which
were destroyed by the fire of January 17th, 1863.
The third building was erected in 1868 at the
corner of Albert and Wellesley Streets, and occupied
two floors. On the same site the fourth building
(a four-storeyed one) was erected in 1886.
Mr. P. F. M. Burrows was the architect. The
present building was opened by the Governor, the
Earl of Liverpool, on April 30th, 1913. Mr. Alex.
Wiseman was the architect, and Messrs Grevatt
and Sons the contractors. The sister institution&mdash;the
Y.W.C.A.&mdash;was not founded until 1878. From
that date until 1903 the association used rented
premises. In 1903 a building, originally designed
for a warehouse, was acquired in Wellesley Street
East, where it carried on its activities until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
present premises in Upper Queen Street, designed
by Mr. W. H. Gummer, A.R.I.B.A., were opened
in 1918.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_III" id="Chapter_III">Chapter III</a><br />
<i>Progress and a Slump</i>: 1871-1900</h2>

<p>The three decades from the &rsquo;seventies to the
&rsquo;nineties are characterised by distinct features. At
the opening period the city, which was just recovering
from the effects of the Maori War, was
making steady progress. This advance culminated
in a boom in the &rsquo;eighties, which brought forth
the usual sequel in the following decade&mdash;a financial
crisis, from which it recovered before the
opening of the new century. The official census
reflects these features. The population of the city
in 1871 was 12,937, an increase of 4948 over the
figures of 1861. In 1881 the number had risen to
16,664, an increase in ten years of 3727. Five
years later the residents of Auckland City totalled
33,161, an accession to the population of a hundred
per cent. In 1891 the number had diminished to
28,613, but was again on the up-grade in 1896,
the population at that date being 31,424, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the end of the &rsquo;nineties it had approximated to the
number of people which the city contained in 1886,
fourteen years previously.</p>

<p>The phenomenal increase in the population of
New Zealand in the mid-&rsquo;seventies was due largely
to the control of immigration passing from the
provincial councils to the general government, and
the vigorous policy inaugurated by it. In 1874
and 1875 no fewer than 50,000 immigrants arrived
in the Dominion. Judging by the census returns,
the city did not gain largely by this influx of
immigrants, although the provincial figures show
that the country profited by it. The South Island
was the greater gainer during these years, due
mainly to the prosperity following upon the discovery
of gold and to the better social and
economic conditions which existed there. The South
Island had no Maori War to unsettle it.</p>

<p>The first half of the &rsquo;eighties, however, found the
Auckland Province booming, and in this prosperity
the city shared. The progress, however, was too
rapid to be healthy; it was not built upon steady
work, but was in the nature of speculation, particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>larly
in land, which could not be characterised as
wise. The inevitable happened; financial undertakings,
great and small, became involved, and
many succumbed. Amongst such institutions, the
Bank of New Zealand, with its New Zealand shareholders,
was numbered. Its failure would have
brought ruin or serious hardship to many people,
and the manner in which the Government of the
day came to the rescue has already been indicated
(<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>). During the depression many residents
sold out and emigrated to Australia, or elsewhere,
some permanently, others temporarily. Houses and
shops everywhere became vacant, and rents became
absurdly low. In some cases people shut up their
houses, boarded over doors and windows, and went
away. The young city was experiencing the most
serious reverse in its history, but the speed with
which it recovered itself demonstrated its vitality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With the advent of the &rsquo;seventies, Auckland may
be said to have arrived at the modern period; the
previous thirty years being now looked upon as
the colonising era. In 1871 the city was constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
by Proclamation under &ldquo;The Municipal Corporations
Act, 1867,&rdquo; and in the same year the Auckland
Harbour Board, to which the administration
of the port was delegated by an Act of Parliament
of the previous year, held its first meeting.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the city had been defined in
&ldquo;The City Board Act, 1863,&rdquo; and were confirmed
in the Proclamation of 1871. They were as follows:&mdash;Stanley
Street, Symonds Street, Karangahape
Road, Ponsonby Road, and Franklin Road.
From this small area&mdash;some 623 acres&mdash;it has
grown by the amalgamation of adjacent districts.
The first addition was made in 1882, when the
highway districts of Ponsonby (755 acres), Karangahape
(139 acres) and Grafton (88 acres) were
annexed to the city. Until 1913 the boundaries
remained stationary, but from that date the
following districts have joined the city:&mdash;Arch

<p>The urgency and necessity of a satisfactory
system of local government may be estimated by
the unhappy condition of the city with regard to
its water supply. The only water obtainable prior
to 1869 (apart from rain-water stored in barrels,
etc., by householders) was drawn from the various
wells, fed by springs. In January, 1872, owing
to a drought, water was sold in the streets by
hawkers. This state of affairs resulted in the
Corporation arranging to pump 30,000 gallons of
water daily from Seccombe&rsquo;s Well, Khyber Pass
Road. The water was stored in a small reservoir,
situated on the top of the Domain Hill, the remains
of which are still visible. Later, in 1875, the
City Council purchased, for £20,000, Western
Springs, from which source the city&rsquo;s water supply
was obtained for many years. At this period
the Council did not embrace the same wide field
of activity which it does now; road formation,
water and sewerage being the principal undertakings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>New City Markets were opened on June 20th,
1873, the foundation stone having been laid on
November 11th of the preceding year. The Mayor
(Mr. P. A. Philips) performed both ceremonies.
The building cost £10,000, and was used until the
present markets were completed in 1917 and 1918.</p>

<p>Auckland&rsquo;s first trams, which were horse-drawn,
and were conducted by a company, commenced
running on August 11, 1884. The route traversed
was from the Waitemata Hotel by Queen Street to
the Ponsonby reservoir, and the fare was threepence.</p>

<p>The building of the Public Library and Art
Gallery was an event in the history of the city,
and was indicative of the desire for knowledge
and advancement which was a feature of the time.
The Mechanics&rsquo; Institute had fallen on evil days,
and the City Council acquired the premises, stock
and freehold in 1880. The building, part of which
was then some 38 years old, was not in good repair,
nor was it large enough for the purposes of an
up-to-date library. Two years after the founding
of the Public Library, Sir George Grey offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
present his books, pictures and curios to the city.
The City Council thereupon decided to erect a
building which would suitably house these and
other collections. Designs for a library and art
gallery building were invited, and that of Messrs.
Grainger and D&rsquo;Ebro, of Melbourne, was accepted.
The foundation stone was laid on 4th June, 1885,
by the Mayor (Mr. William Richard Waddel), and
the Library was opened on March 26th, 1887, Mr.
A. E. T. Devore, Mayor, presiding. Messrs. James
Malcolm and William Price were the contractors.
The contract was let for £21,851. The Art Gallery
was opened a year later, on February 17th.</p>

<p>The growth of the Public Library and Art Gallery
has been both rapid and interesting. At its
inception the stock consisted of some 6000 volumes,
the majority of which were acquired from the Provincial
Council Library. At the opening of the new
building the collection numbered 15,000 volumes,
the increase being largely due to the accession of
Sir George Grey&rsquo;s library. From 1887 until 1898,
Sir George kept adding to the library, enriching
it to such an extent that the Auckland Library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
obtained what is, perhaps, an unique position
among municipal libraries throughout the world.
Among the 15,000 volumes which he presented are
many rare and interesting early manuscripts, some
being illuminated, a valuable array of incunabula,
including three Caxtons, and a number of literary
treasures, amongst which the first, second and
fourth folios of Shakespeare, as well as the
&ldquo;Poems&rdquo; of Shakespeare, 1640, are worthy of
special mention. The Grey collection also contains
an interesting series of autograph letters.</p>

<p>Later bequests to the Library include the J. T.
Mackelvie collection, the McKechnie collection, the
Fred Shaw collection and the Henry Shaw collection.
The last-mentioned runs on somewhat similar
lines to the Grey collection, and contains many
Oriental and other manuscripts, a large number
of Fifteenth and Sixteenth Century printed books,
and a splendid collection of works in general
literature in best copies. The section dealing with
arts and crafts is especially noteworthy. There are
also a number of grangerised books, the &ldquo;Edinburgh
Folio Shakespeare,&rdquo; which has over 3000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
illustrations added to it, being the most important.
Further particularisation of these collections is
impossible here, but these brief remarks may give
some slight idea of their literary, artistic and
bibliographical value. Of monetary bequests, mention
should be made of Mr. Edward Costley&rsquo;s gift
of £12,150.</p>

The progress illustrated in these pictures may be taken as typical of the growth of the
City&rsquo;s Institutions in general</p>
</div>

<p>The Art Gallery has been equally fortunate. The
nucleus of the gallery, consisting mainly of old
masters and other pictures, was given by Sir George
Grey, and other public spirited citizens have followed
his example. The most notable bequest,
however, was that of the late James Tannock Mackelvie,
who bequeathed, in 1885, his valuable art
collection, along with a large sum of money, in
trust, to establish and maintain a Museum of Fine
Art for the people of Auckland. By an arrangement
between the trustees and the Corporation, an addition
was made to the Art Gallery building, and
the collection deposited there. It now contains a
well chosen selection of modern British and Continental
pictures and <i>objets d&rsquo;art</i>. Altogether, the
Auckland Art Gallery takes the premier position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
among institutions of its kind in New Zealand. To
provide accommodation for the rapidly increasing
number of pictures, a further addition was made
to the Gallery in 1916, and was opened by Mr.
J. H. Gunson, Mayor, on December 6th, but already
the room has proved insufficient for the growth of
the collections. The city authorities have specialised
in New Zealand art, and this section contains an
interesting group of paintings by local artists.</p>

<p>The Old Colonists&rsquo; Museum, which is housed in
the Library and Art Gallery building, was opened
on March 22, 1916, by the Mayor (Mr. J. H.
Gunson). It contains an extensive collection of
pictures, maps, plans and mementoes illustrating
the early days of New Zealand, especially North
Auckland and the city.</p>

<p>The Elam School of Art, which was established
by the will of the late Dr. J. E. Elam, who bequeathed
a sum of £6500 for the purpose, was
located in the Public Library building from 1890
until 1915; in this year the school was moved to
a new building which had been erected in Rutland
Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of the Harbour Board, as far as the
city is concerned, has been devoted principally to
reclamation and wharves. Prior to the constitution
of the Harbour Board, the port was under the
control of the Provincial Council. Some reclamation
had been carried out by that body, for at
the time of the transference of the control from
the Provincial Council to the Board considerable
alteration had taken place on the foreshores. In
the &rsquo;forties, Commercial Bay swept round from
Britomart Point along a beach, which subsequently
became Fort Street, to a headland known successively
as Stanley Point and Smales Point. This
promontory stood in the vicinity of Albert Street
and Customs Street West. By 1870 the foreshore
had been reclaimed, and Customs Street East added
to the city&rsquo;s highways. At that date Customs Street
ended at the foot of a cliff, and a long flight of
steps, known as &ldquo;Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder,&rdquo; led up to Emily
Place. On the western side of Queen Street, Customs
Street finished at the waterfront opposite
Albert Street.</p>

<p>The wharf accommodation in 1870 was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
small indeed. The first Auckland wharf was the
Wynyard Pier, which was built in the &rsquo;forties, and
was situated in Official Bay in a direct line from
Short Street. Commercial Bay had from the first
been selected as the shipping centre of Auckland,
and by 1852, one can gather from <a href="#image013">Hogan&rsquo;s engraving</a>
(p. 72) that considerable work has been expended
upon the improvement of the facilities for
loading and unloading vessels. The Queen Street
Wharf has always been the principal wharf, but in
1852 there was a small pier leading from the lane
which ran from the Victoria Hotel to Shortland
Street, and east of Graham&rsquo;s Bond (a stone building
which still stands in Fort Street, but at that time
was right on the waterfront) there was a landing
stage. Between 1852 and 1870 a new wooden
wharf replaced the Queen Street one, another was
erected opposite Gore Street, and a breakwater
had been built from Britomart Point.</p>

<p>This was the state of the waterfront when the
Harbour Board undertook the management of the
port.</p>

<p>One of the earliest tasks the Board undertook was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the demolition of Point Britomart, which occupied
several years to accomplish. The spoil was used
for reclamation between that point and Queen
Street, and on this area the railway yards, electric
power station, cold stores, and other establishments
have been built, adding Quay Street to the number
of city thoroughfares.</p>

<p>To the west of Queen Street the reclaimed area
can be easily distinguished on account of the regular
low-lying nature of the streets comprised within
it. If one follows a route from Queen Street along
Customs, Sturdee, Fanshawe, Halsey, Patteson and
Beaumont Streets, where the last named street
junctions with Fanshawe Street, this would give
roughly the foreshore as it existed in 1870. The
reclamations, which include the area now occupied
by Victoria Park, were completed about 1900.</p>

<p>The Harbour Board is still engaged upon reclamation
work, adding considerably to the city and
port&rsquo;s facilities.</p>

<p>The wharves did not alter much during the first
thirty years of the Board&rsquo;s control. In this period
the Queen Street Wharf was practically rebuilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and considerably enlarged, and the Railway Wharf
erected. At a later date, Hobson Street Wharf, the
Quay Street Jetty and other jetties were built. In
the &rsquo;eighties Gore Street Wharf was demolished
in connection with the Quay Street reclamations,
and extra wharf provision was made parallel to
this street. All these wharves were constructed of
wood. In 1900 the comprehensive scheme of
wharves in concrete was commenced, and has been
steadily pushed forward. At the present time the
port&rsquo;s wharves are a credit to the authorities, alike
in size, number and equipment, and, although the
accommodation for ships has been greatly increased,
the Board is occupied with further extensions,
to enable it to keep pace with the growth of
the port&rsquo;s shipping.</p>

<p>Docking accommodation for the repair of vessels
was also put in hand by the Harbour Board. On
May 1st, 1876, the Auckland Graving Dock, which
was situated opposite Hobson Street, was commenced,
and was opened on August 20th, 1878.
This dock was used for small vessels. It was abandoned
in 1913 and the site filled in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Calliope Dock, on the North Shore, was
opened by the Governor (Sir William F. D. Jervois)
on February 16th, 1888, in the presence of
Admiral Fairfax, commander of the fleet on the
Australasian station. The day was made the occasion
of a public holiday. Bunting was to be seen
everywhere: in the city, at Devonport, and on the
vessels in the harbour. Two of her Majesty&rsquo;s ships
of war, the <i>Calliope</i> and <i>Diamond</i>, steamed into
the new dock, the former cutting the ribbon
stretched across. The dock was, when opened, the
largest graving dock possessed by any colony, and
had cost up to that date £135,000. It required an
additional expenditure of £20,000 to make it as
complete as possible. Mr. Pierce Lanigan was the
contractor, Mr. W. Errington the engineer, and
Mr. Swainson clerk of works.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Calliope</i>, which, as has been mentioned,
was the first vessel to enter the dock, became
famous in the annals of seamanship only a month
later, when, during the great storm of 16th March,
1888, which struck Samoa, she sailed out from
Apia under the command of Captain Kane. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the vessels which remained in the harbour were
wrecked.</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>A hoax perpetrated by Mr. D. M. Luckie, editor
of the <i>Southern Cross</i>, which for the time being
created consternation and serious excitement in
the city and district, occurred on the morning of
February 17th, 1873, when the <i>Daily Southern
Cross</i> printed a report purporting to be a description
of the capture of Auckland by the Russian
man-of-war <i>Kaskowiski</i>. The article described in
detail the capture &ldquo;of the British warship lying in
the waters of the Waitemata,&rdquo; the seizure &ldquo;of our
principal citizens as hostages,&rdquo; the demand of &ldquo;a
heavy ransom for the city,&rdquo; and the emptying of
&ldquo;the coffers of the banks of all the gold and specie
they contained.&rdquo; Although the report had a foot-note
stating that it was taken &ldquo;from the <i>Daily
Southern Cross</i> of Monday, the 15th May, 1873,&rdquo;
quite a large number of people were deceived by
it. One woman, the <i>New Zealand Herald</i> stated,
became hysterical on reading the account, while a
gentleman made preparations for the flight of himself,
his wife and family to their farm at the Hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Springs. A Queen Street shopkeeper, after reading
the report, put up his shutters and reappeared,
fully armed, &ldquo;ready for the fray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trouble Great Britain was having in India,
in which Russia was implicated, gave a semblance
of probability to the report. At the same time, it
is surprising that such a palpable hoax could have
misled anyone. The purpose which the newspaper
had in producing the article was stated in the next
issue to be to &ldquo;direct attention to the necessity of
these colonies being properly protected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eight years later, on 12th December, 1881, the
Russian cruiser <i>Africa</i> visited Auckland without
causing consternation among the citizens. Better
relations now obtained between the two nations,
and Admiral Aslanbexoff, who was in command,
was welcomed to the city by the civic authorities,
and dined with the Mayor and Mayoress (Mr. and
Mrs. J. McCosh Clark) on the evening of the ship&rsquo;s
arrival.</p>

<p>Educational matters received long-delayed attention
in this period. As we have already mentioned,
the Grammar School commenced its career in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
last year of the &rsquo;sixties, but, until the passing of
&ldquo;The Education Act&rdquo; of 1877, elementary education
had been carried on by private and denominational
schools, the latter system being introduced
in 1847 by Sir George Grey, who realised that
the only organisations fit to undertake the work
of education were the churches. When the education
system passed into the care of the Provincial
Council, that body passed, in 1857, an Act for
the better regulation of education, but the Council
was too hard pressed financially to be able to do
much. The Act of 1877, however, placed the
education of children on a stable basis, providing
for free, compulsory and secular teaching. Following
the passing of this Act, a number of private
schools came under the national authority. Since
then the system has developed, and at the present
time there are eighteen primary schools within
the city boundaries which supply instruction to
over 11,000 children.</p>

<p>Apart from the primary and secondary education
systems, Auckland was noticeably deficient in
the higher branches of education and in the educa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>tional
facilities provided for the working man. In
fact, except for the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, there was
no provision for general or technical education
available. Much credit is due to this Institute for
what it did in the thirty-eight years of its existence
to stimulate interest among, and provide opportunities
of self-improvement to, the youth of the
community. In glancing through the early files of
newspapers, the Institute would seem to have been
the Mecca of all things intellectual. During these
years it carried on series of lectures by the best
lecturers available, and in 1873 classes of instruction
were founded, to which sixty men were joined.
Among the subjects taught were arithmetic, mathematics,
architectural and mechanical drawing, and,
more interesting still, there was a class for the study
of Maori. These classes were successful, and the
Committee of the Institute arranged an exhibition
of Fine and Useful Arts, which was opened by the
Superintendent of the Province, on Boxing Day,
1873. A few years after this exhibition, the Mechanics&rsquo;
Institute began to experience difficulties,
which ultimately led to its extinction. During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
&rsquo;seventies and &rsquo;eighties the Y.M.C.A. carried out
courses of lectures in the winter months, which
were popular and well patronised.</p>

<p>After the closing of the classes at the Mechanics&rsquo;
Institute, technical education in Auckland seems
to have fallen into neglect until 1896, when the
Auckland Technical School was founded, and carried
on its work in Rutland Street. In 1900 &ldquo;The
Manual and Technical Instruction Act&rdquo; was passed,
and the following year the Education Board took
over the control of the school, and appointed Mr.
G. George director. So rapidly did the school
develop that a new building became essential, and
the promise of a contribution of £10,000 towards
its erection having been made by the Auckland
Savings Bank in 1905, steps were taken to carry
out the proposal. On August 17th, 1909, the
foundation stone of the present college was laid
by the Governor, Lord Plunket, and the building
was opened in 1913 by Sir James Allen, Minister
for Education and Defence. Mr. John Mitchell
was the architect, and Mr. Stanley Jeffreys the
builder; but, owing to the lack of funds, the build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ing
as planned was not finished. Additions to meet
requirements are now in course of erection. The
progress of the college may be estimated by the
figures of attendance. In 1902 the number of
pupils was thirty. At the opening of the new school
(1913) there were 1627 individual students in
attendance at day or night classes.</p>

<p>In 1872 Sir George Maurice O&rsquo;Rorke, whose
whole life was associated with the Auckland University
College, and who was Chairman of the
Council from its inception until his death on 24th
August, 1916, made an unsuccessful effort to institute
a university in the city. Five years later
another agitation was set in being, and resulted
in the appointment of a Royal Commission on University
and Secondary Education, which reported
in July, 1879. Its recommendations were embodied
in the &ldquo;Auckland University College Act,
1882.&rdquo; The Bill was introduced by Mr. J. A. Tole
in 1881, when it was shelved, but received legislative
sanction in the following year. To accelerate
the opening of the college, the Premier sent instructions
to the Agent-General in London to appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
professors, and upon the arrival of the staff the
college was opened by the Governor, Sir William
F. D. Jervois, on May 21st, 1883, in the buildings
in Eden Street, formerly used as a District Court
House, and the old Admiralty House, Short Street.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Council came into possession
of the Parliament buildings, which had
latterly been used by the Provincial Council, and,
with additions along Eden Street, these premises,
rich in historic association, but wholly inadequate
and unsuitable for a college, had perforce to serve
their purpose until 1917, when the buildings were
taken over by the City Council in connection with
the Anzac Avenue roadway, forcing the College
Council to find other quarters. These were found
in the old Grammar School buildings, Symonds
Street, where provision was made for the Arts,
Law, Commerce and Music faculties; the Science
departments were accommodated on a site adjoining
Government House grounds, which belonged
to the College, and here a two-storey building was
erected, in the design of which the architects,
Messrs. Goldsbro&rsquo; and Cumming utilised the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Choral Hall. The building was officially opened
on June 7th, 1919, by the Acting-Premier, Sir
James Allen. The contract for the building and
alterations was let for £14,767. Fittings and scientific
equipment absorbed another £10,000.</p>

<p>The one thing which has stood in the path of the
progress of the college has been local disruption
with regard to the site. This question has been discussed
time after time. The dispute is now settled,
and the ground adjoining the Science block was
secured in 1919. Competitive designs were invited
for a modern building, and the plan of Messrs.
Lippincott and Billson, Melbourne, which it is
estimated will cost £97,000, was accepted. The
building is expected to be completed in 1925.</p>

<p>Much credit is due to Mr. T. W. Leys, who succeeded
Sir Maurice O&rsquo;Rorke as Chairman of the
College Council, for the position which now obtains
in local university affairs, for it is largely due to
his energy that the site question has been settled
and the future of the college placed on a satisfactory
basis. In recognition of his services to university
education, the McGill University of Toronto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in 1920, conferred on him the degree of LL.D.</p>

<p>The most important among the few endowments
which the college has received was the gift of
£3000 made by Mr. Thomas Bannatyne Gillies, a
Judge of the Supreme Court, for the purpose of
endowing two scientific scholarships, to be named
respectively the Sinclair and Gillies Scholarships.</p>

</div>

<p>Fires between &rsquo;71 and &rsquo;90 were numerous,
despite the fact that the early wooden buildings
were being replaced by bricks and mortar, but
only those representing damages of not less than
£10,000 are noticed here. A serious outbreak happened
a few minutes before midnight on the 19th
November, 1872. It was supposed to have originated
in Mr. Frank Scherff&rsquo;s store, on the northern
side of Fort Street, and developed first on the western
side of that building, involving the Pacific Fire
Insurance premises and another; it then spread
in an easterly direction to the buildings occupied
by the Waikato Transport Company, Messrs.
Bucholz and Messrs. Webb, and although these
were divided by brick walls, they were soon ablaze.
The fire then crossed the thoroughfare and attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the Government buildings, including the Post Office,
the Telegraph Office, the Customs House and the
offices of the Provincial Council. The Fire Brigades,
which were early on the scene, were blamed
for allowing the Post Office to become ignited, but
it is only just to state that the hoses were in a very
bad condition, and handicapped the firemen in
their work. The damage amounted to £50,000.
The postal buildings, which were destroyed, cost
some £30,000 to erect, and were not insured.</p>

<p>The most calamitous fire which had so far overtaken
the city took place on September the 6th,
1873, causing the destruction of fifty-four buildings,
mostly shops, business premises, and some
dwellings, the damages being assessed at £70,000.
The outbreak was reported to have commenced in
Mrs. Powley&rsquo;s millinery establishment in Queen
Street, which occupied the site where Darby Street
stands to-day, and so rapidly did the fire spread
that in less than an hour the whole of the west side
of the street, up to the United Service Hotel, at the
corner of Wellesley Street, was ablaze; the fire
then crossed Wellesley Street and its progress up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Queen Street to the Anchor Hotel was as rapid
as in the other block. Before it ran its course
it involved an area bounded by Victoria Street,
the old markets site, Queen Street and Elliott
Street. While the fire was at its height there was
a mild panic, owing to the fear that the conflagration
would burn down the city. A large amount of
damage was caused by over zealous helpers, who,
in their endeavours to save property from the
flames, threw household furniture, including pianos
even, out of doors and windows, where many of
the articles were smashed against the pavement.</p>

<p>Later in the same year another fire occurred, on
October the 14th. Commencing either in the back
store of Mr. J. Macfarlane or in Messrs. Henderson
and Macfarlane, which were adjacent, the flames
completely destroyed both premises, and extended
to the buildings occupied by Messrs. Stone, Leaning,
Bucholz (who had been burned out in the fire
of 1872) and Ellingham. The damage amounted
to £40,000.</p>

<p>A row of the few remaining wooden buildings
which still survived in Queen Street, situated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the south-east corner of Victoria Street, were burned
down in an hour and a half on May 10th, 1876.
The fire extended as far back as Lorne Street, and
caused damage estimated at £10,000.</p>

<p>Two timber mills were responsible for large
fires, involving losses amounting to £10,000 each.
The first of these occurred at the Union Sash and
Door Company, Mechanics Bay, on July 25th,
1883; the other took place on January 10th, 1885,
at the Auckland Timber Company&rsquo;s mill, Customs
Street, where half a million feet of timber was set
on fire, creating a magnificent spectacle. The gas
works, which were located near by, were carefully
watched, in case of danger. At this fire the crew
of the U.S. ship <i>Iroquois</i> rendered valuable help.</p>

<p>The last fire to occur within this period took
place at the Ph&oelig;nix Foundry, the business of
Messrs. George Fraser and Sons, Stanley Street,
on October 19th, 1893, causing damage amounting
to five figures.</p>

<p>The weather was also the means of bringing
about losses to the community, and the gale which
struck Auckland on February 7th, 1874, caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the death of seven persons by drowning, and
damage to shipping and harbour works amounting
to over £12,000. No fewer than twenty-five vessels
were either damaged or sunk during the storm.
On the waterfront the embankments were breached
at several places, and sheds injured or destroyed.
The owners of small craft sustained extremely
serious loss. In comparison with the havoc done
in the harbour the damage inland was negligible.</p>

<p>In the previous section the shipping of the port
was sketched up to the temporary service that took
the place of the Panama Company&rsquo;s service, which
ceased in 1869. In 1871 an agreement was made
by the Government with Messrs. Webb and Holladay,
owners of the California Line, to run a fleet
of four paddle steamers, <i>viz</i>, <i>Nevada</i> (2145 tons),
<i>Nebraska</i> (2143 tons), <i>Dacotah</i> (2145 tons)&mdash;all
of which were fitted with beam engines&mdash;and <i>Moses
Taylor</i> (1354 tons), from Sydney to San Francisco.
Auckland was again the port of call, but
for a few trips at the commencement of the service
Port Chalmers was made the New Zealand port
of call alternately with Auckland, on which occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>sions
Napier, Wellington and Lyttelton were visited
<i>en route</i>. In 1873 the United States withdrew the
subsidy, and, as the line had become unpopular
with the Australian and New Zealand Governments,
the service was ended. Another temporary service
was run by Mr. Hall, first by the steamers <i>Tartar</i>
and <i>Mongol</i>, and later by the <i>Cyphrenes</i> and
<i>Mikado</i>; a few trips were made by the <i>City of
Melbourne</i>. The route followed was by Fiji (Kandavu).
An offer of the Pacific Mail Company, in
conjunction with the Fairfield Shipbuilding Company
of Glasgow, was accepted, and inaugurated
in 1875, the Fiji route being followed until 1877,
when the Honolulu course was adopted. The ships
engaged in this service were <i>Vasco de Gama</i>,
<i>Colima</i>, <i>City of San Francisco</i>, <i>City of New York</i>,
<i>City of Sydney</i>, <i>Zealandia</i>, and <i>Australia</i>. The
contract expired in 1885. The next contract was
divided between the Oceanic Company of America
and the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand.
The Oceanic Company put into commission
the <i>Alameda</i> and <i>Mariposa</i> (3158 tons), and the
Union Company the <i>Mararoa</i> (2598 tons). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
latter was withdrawn, and was replaced in 1890
by the same company&rsquo;s new liner <i>Monowai</i> (3433
tons). The <i>Arawa</i> substituted the <i>Monowai</i> in this
service for a time, but in 1897 the <i>Moana</i> finally
took up the run. In 1900, owing to the legislative
enactment of the United States precluding any but
American ships from plying between American
ports, the <i>Moana</i> was transferred to the Vancouver
service. The <i>Alameda</i> and <i>Mariposa</i> were also
withdrawn, and were replaced by the <i>Sierra</i>, which
inaugurated a three-weekly service from &rsquo;Frisco.
She was followed by the <i>Sonoma</i> and <i>Ventura</i>.
This service lasted till 1909, when the New Zealand
Government followed the example of the United
States, and withdrew the subsidy.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Shipping Company, a Dominion
concern, was established in 1873, and ten years
later a direct line of steam communication was
inaugurated by the company&rsquo;s steamer <i>British
King</i>, which began the Government mail contract
on January 26th, 1883, when the steamer left
London, travelling <i>via</i> Cape Horn. Five steamers
were built for this direct service. Since the Panama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Canal was opened, this company has used that
route.</p>

<p>The Shaw, Savill and Albion Line about this
time placed steamers in the New Zealand run, and
the service has continued up to the present. Other
lines, including the Tyser and White Star lines,
have been engaged upon the New Zealand trade.</p>

<p>In the &rsquo;seventies, trade with the Islands attracted
Auckland business men, and the <i>Star of the South</i>
(Captain W. Farquhar) commenced a monthly service
between New Zealand and Fiji.</p>

<p>The coastal services from Auckland developed
rapidly in this period, and culminated in the formation
of the Northern Steamship Company on
May 11th, 1881. The company was formed to take
over the steamers and trade of the Auckland Steam
Packet Company, and other local steamers. It continued
to absorb the other steamer services, including
the Coromandel Steamship Company, and, in
1906, the Manukau Steamship Company. The
Northern Steamship Company has now forty vessels
in its fleet, trading to every part of the province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>A most serious shipping calamity took place on
October 28th, 1894, when the Union Steamship
Company&rsquo;s steamer <i>Wairarapa</i> (1786 tons) was
wrecked at Miner&rsquo;s Head, Great Barrier, on her
voyage from Sydney to Auckland. She left Port
Jackson with 230 souls on board. Rounding Cape
Maria van Diemen on Sunday morning, the ship
ran into a fog. In the fog she mistook her course,
and when she crashed on the reef she was twenty-five
miles out of it. The death-roll was enormous,
127 passengers and crew, including Captain McIntosh,
being drowned. The boats on the port side
got away safely, but the starboard boats capsized,
owing to the list, and the passengers were precipitated
into the water, some of them being drowned.
The survivors on the ship spent many miserable
hours until dawn. As soon as daylight appeared
efforts were made by the survivors to get off the
ship. Mr. Leighton climbed to the mast-head and
detached the signal halyard, with which the second
engineer essayed to swim ashore, but failed. One
of the stewards took up the heroic task. He succeeded,
and along this thin line of life all passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
in safety, save two. The first person, a lady, who
reached safety by this means, did so by moving
hand over hand, but afterwards an endless line was
fixed, on which the remainder of those on board
made their escape.</p>

<p>Three years later the Huddart-Parker Company&rsquo;s
inter-colonial steamer <i>Tasmania</i> was wrecked, on
July 29th, 1897, while on a voyage from Auckland
to Napier. The weather at the time was dirty and
thick, and after sheltering for some time off Gisborne,
Captain McGee decided to make for Napier.
In the dark the vessel struck a rock off Table Cape,
and the captain ordered the passengers and crew to
take to the boats. Fortunately, everybody on board
got away, and all the boats but two reached land
safely. One of these, the carpenter&rsquo;s boat, capsized
off Kawakawa, and a passenger and one of the crew
were drowned. The other boat contained eight
members of the crew, all of whom were drowned.</p>

<p>A disaster connected with the coastal shipping
occurred on March 31st, 1893, when the steamer
<i>Ruby</i> was wrecked on Managawai Bar, 50 miles
from Auckland, two lives being lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The commercial progress of the city was continued
in the &rsquo;seventies, and is illustrated by the
appearance of another insurance company of Auckland
origin. The new concern was the South British
Fire and Marine Insurance Company, which commenced
operations in August, 1872, with an initial
capital of half a million. Like its elder brother,
the New Zealand Insurance Company, it soon
extended its field of activity beyond the confines
of the Dominion, but did not meet with the same
success, and in 1890 a thorough reorganisation of
the business took place, since when the advancement
of the company has been uniformly consistent.</p>

<p>The advent of a new banking concern was another
indication of the commercial prosperity of
Auckland. The National Bank of New Zealand
opened up business in 1874 in temporary premises
on the eastern side of Queen Street, but later in the
year it was removed to the present building, at the
corner of Queen and Wyndham Streets. Messrs.
R. W. Keals and Son were the architects.</p>

<p>The mercantile and industrial development which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Auckland had made since the financial crisis in
the &rsquo;eighties was remarkable, and culminated in
the Mining and Industrial Exhibition of 1898-99,
the first modern exhibition that the city had undertaken.
The object of the exhibition was to promote
and develop local manufactures, mining and productive
industries. Mr. Bartholomew Kent was the
originator of the exhibition, and, on his suggestion,
the Chamber of Commerce, of which he was president
at the time, convened a meeting on June 3rd,
1897, for the purpose of forming a committee to
carry out the proposal. Mr. Kent was appointed
president of the executive, with Mr. W. R. Holmes,
secretary. The work of planning and laying out
the exhibition was entrusted to Mr. R. W. de Montalk
and Mr. H. D. Griffiths, who were respectively
architect and engineer to the exhibition. The buildings,
which occupied five acres adjoining Government
House grounds, were simple but tasteful in
design, and cost about £5000 to erect. On the
Symonds Street frontage of the grounds a sports
area was located, which had cycle and running
tracks, and accommodation for 6000 spectators.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
The Choral Hall adjoining was utilised for the
musical events. Mr. F. N. Meadows was the Director
of the Exhibition.</p>

<p>The Exhibition was opened by the Governor,
the Earl of Ranfurly, on 1st December, 1898, and
continued until February of the following year. It
was estimated that it was visited by a quarter of
a million persons in that time. Financially and socially
the Exhibition was completely successful.</p>

<p>Labour and union questions began to interest
tradesmen about this period, and in 1872 the Trades
and Labour Council was founded. Whatever disputes
arose during these years appear to have been
easily adjusted, for no strike of any importance is
recorded to have taken place in New Zealand until
the maritime strike of August, 1890, which involved
the New Zealand members of these unions.
The strike lasted until November, when conditions
again became normal.</p>

<p>Auckland&rsquo;s first Eight Hours&rsquo; Demonstration
took place on April 19th, 1882. Like its successor,
the Labour Day Demonstration, it took the form of
a procession of unionists, some 500 in number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
who marshalled in the city and travelled to the
Domain, where sports were indulged in. At night
the festivities were continued with a supper and
dance.</p>

<p>Auckland has always been a fortunate city in
respect to benefactors, some of whom have been
already noticed. Two others must be mentioned
here. Mr. Edward Costley, who died on April
18th, 1883, bequeathed the sum of £84,700 in
equal shares to the following city institutions:&mdash;Institute
and Museum, Public Library, Hospital,
Orphan Home, Costley Home for the Aged Poor,
Sailors&rsquo; Home, and Boys&rsquo; Institute. Mr. James
Dilworth, the other benefactor, died on December
23rd, 1894, leaving estate valued at £100,000, to
be applied to the maintenance and education of
orphans or of children of persons of good character
and in straitened circumstances, the education
to extend to secondary schools and the university
if the children show fitness for such.</p>

<p>The Jubilee Institute for the Blind was founded
on July 9th, 1890. The present site was purchased
in 1891, and a dwelling which stood on it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
renovated and opened as a school. As the pupils
increased, additions were made, including a workshop
for blind men. Early in the history of the
Institute a building fund had been inaugurated,
with the view of erecting a permanent building.
The bequest of £10,000 of Mr. Wm. Mason, who
died in 1905, and the energy of Mr. John Abbott,
enabled the trustees to realise their hopes earlier
than otherwise would have been possible. The
foundation stone of the new building was laid by
the Hon. Geo. Fowlds, Minister for Education, in
May, 1907, and on the 21st May, 1909, the building
was officially opened by the Governor, Lord
Plunket. Mr. E. Bartley was the architect, and
Messrs. Philcox and Son the contractors, the cost
of the building being £13,735.</p>

<p>The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria was
celebrated in Auckland on June 22nd, 1897, and
during the following week. For the occasion the
city was elaborately decorated, every building
and vantage point being utilised, and at night,
illuminations, bonfires and fireworks were to be
seen everywhere. Both decorations and illumina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>tions
surpassed anything of the kind ever previously
attempted in Auckland. The formal celebrations
comprised a magnificent procession, in
which the navy, the army, the corporations of the
city and suburban districts, the Harbour Board
and other institutions took part, as well as the
children of the public schools. The vehicles taking
part were gaily decorated, and banners were conspicuous.
The procession travelled from Queen
Street to the Domain, where 20,000 people were
congregated. Mr. P. Dignan, Mayor, delivered an
address, and concluded by asking the school children,
numbering about 2,000, to sing the National
Anthem. The military part of the proceedings
consisted of the firing of a Royal salute, a review
and a march past, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Banks, in which all the regiments
of the city, cadets and veterans took part. The
review was followed by a military tournament,
which was witnessed by over 15,000 people.</p>

<p>In connection with the celebrations a committee,
with the Mayor as chairman, was appointed to take
steps to commemorate the sixty years&rsquo; reign of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Queen. The committee decided to erect a statue.
On the 80th anniversary of the Queen&rsquo;s birthday
(24th May, 1899) this monument&mdash;the first statue
of the Queen erected in New Zealand&mdash;which
stands in Albert Park, was unveiled by the Governor,
the Earl of Ranfurly. It was designed by
Mr. Williamson.</p>

<p>The closing years of Victoria&rsquo;s reign were darkened
by the outbreak of hostilities in South Africa,
in 1899. The war was not at first considered to be
a serious affair, but the Colonial Governments
nevertheless at once offered their assistance to the
Imperial authorities. Opinions differed then, as
now, as to the wisdom of the war, and it is in no
controversial spirit that mention is made here to
the subject. It would, however, be impossible to
pass over the event without referring to it as a
matter of history. New Zealand sent ten contingents
to South Africa, the first sailing on 21st October,
1899, and the last at the beginning of 1902. The
total number of men despatched was upwards of
6000 of all ranks, and an equal number of horses.
Auckland was well represented in these forces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
some of which sailed direct from the Waitemata.</p>

<p>The Veterans&rsquo; Home, Mount Roskill, which was
opened by the Governor, the Earl of Ranfurly, on
10th December, 1903, was established as a national
war memorial to the New Zealanders who died in
the South African War, and to provide a home for
aged veterans. The successful accomplishment of
the project was due in a large measure to the energy
of the Governor. The home has now passed into
the control of the Auckland Patriotic and War
Relief Association.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IV" id="Chapter_IV">Chapter IV</a><br />
<i>Prosperity and Expansion: 1901-1920</i></h2>

<p>The last twenty years of Auckland&rsquo;s history have
continued the prosperity which commenced in the
late &rsquo;nineties, with the recovery from the slump.
The rise in the population illustrates this clearly.
The increase was slow, but steady, in the first decade;
in the next it reached almost a record rate.
At the 1901 census the population of the city was
34,213, a small increase of 2789 over the figures
of 1896. Ten years later the numbers had risen
to 40,536, and in 1916 to 64,951. At the recent
enumeration, taken at the opening of the present
year (1921), the city&rsquo;s population totalled 83,467,
an increase in the last ten years exceeding 100
per cent. The recent increase is partly attributable
to the amalgamation of contiguous local bodies
with the city, the details of which are given on
<a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>, but the main cause of the city&rsquo;s prosperity
is due to the position which Auckland holds as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
principal city of the large and wealthy pastoral
districts which surround it. The agricultural industry
has made wonderful progress in these years,
and the city, being the natural medium of exchange
between the producer and the oversea markets,
advanced rapidly as an important commercial
centre. Auckland&rsquo;s prosperity has been built upon
its advantageous commercial position, and the
present ratio of progress is a happy augury of the
future.</p>

<p>The Twentieth Century opened auspiciously with
the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and
York, who arrived in Auckland&mdash;their first port of
call in New Zealand&mdash;on the 10th of June, and
remained here until the 12th. The heir to the
throne and his princess were welcomed to the Dominion
and the city by the Governor, the Earl of
Ranfurly, the Rt. Hon. R. J. Seddon, Prime
Minister, other ministers and members of Parliament,
Dr. (afterwards Sir) John Logan Campbell,
Mayor, and members of the City Council, the
Chairman (Mr. Alfred Kidd) and members of the
Harbour Board. The city was lavishly decorated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the illuminations at night being a feature. On
their journey from the wharf to Government House
Their Royal Highnesses received a welcome, characterised
by unparalleled enthusiasm, from the
citizens, which included some 2500 school children,
who formed a living Union Jack in Wellesley
Street East. During his stay in Auckland the Duke
was present at a military review at Potter&rsquo;s Paddock,
where he distributed medals to men who had
served in the Boer War.</p>

<p>Two interesting events were associated with the
Royal visit, the principal one being the presentation
by Dr. John Logan Campbell of a park of
230 acres, which the donor invited His Royal
Highness to accept on behalf of the people of New
Zealand, and requested him to name it Cornwall
Park, in commemoration of the visit; the other was
the laying of the foundation stone of the Queen
Victoria School for Maori Girls, Parnell, which
the Duke performed on behalf of the Duchess.</p>

<p>The gift of Cornwall Park by the venerable
doctor was the &ldquo;crowning glory of his life,&rdquo; as the
donor himself said. Logan Campbell arrived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
New Zealand in 1839, and, pending the choice of
the capital on the Waitemata, he settled temporarily
on Motu Korea (Brown&rsquo;s Island). As soon
as the site had been fixed he moved over to the
mainland, and was amongst the original buyers of
land at the first Auckland land sale. He became
Superintendent of the Auckland Provincial Council,
1855-56, and at different times represented
Auckland and Parnell in the House of Representatives.
He was associated with practically every
movement to develop Auckland&rsquo;s commercial interests,
and every organisation which had for its
object the social advancement of the city obtained
his willing assistance. In 1901, prior to the Royal
visit, he was appointed Mayor of Auckland, and
no more suitable person could have been found
than this pioneer, who had helped to build the city
from its inception. The following year he was
knighted. He died June 22nd, 1912, and was
buried on the summit of Maungakiekie (One Tree
Hill), the funeral being the most largely attended
in the history of the city. Business was suspended,
and thousands of persons lined the route as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
funeral <i>cortége</i> passed, bearing the mortal remains
of the aged pioneer to its last resting place.</p>

<p>His benefactions during his life included the
Kindergarten, the Crèche and the Nursery, all of
which bear his name, and at his death he bequeathed
to public institutions a total of £76,000.</p>

<p>Cornwall Park was formally opened on August
26th, 1903, the donor leading a procession of carriages,
containing the public men and women of
the city and district, through the new drive from
Manukau road to the Huia Lodge. The Drive to
the hilltop was completed and opened on January
29th, 1907, and the park was vested in a domain
board. With a view to commemorating the gift of
Cornwall Park and Sir John Logan Campbell&rsquo;s
other services to the community, it was decided to
erect a statue of him at the entrance to the park.
The work was entrusted to Mr. Fred Pegram, an
English sculptor. The unveiling was performed by
the Governor, Lord Plunket, on May 24th, 1906,
Sir John himself taking part in the ceremony.</p>

<p>Later in the same year (1901) the distinguished
Scottish general, Sir Hector Macdonald, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
risen from the ranks, visited Auckland on November
8th, and remained in the city until the 11th.
He was welcomed by the Mayor, Mr. Alfred Kidd,
and citizens, the Scottish community in particular
showering hospitality upon him. He spent a busy
time in Auckland, and, amongst other things, inspected
the cadets at the Domain. As a memorial
of his visit, the Scotsmen of the city endowed a cot
at the Hospital, which bears the name of this
famous soldier, whose career closed a few years
later under tragic circumstances.</p>

<p>Eleven years later two other famous generals,
Earl Kitchener and Lieutenant-General Sir Robert
S. S. Baden-Powell, visited Auckland. The former
reached the city on March 1st, 1912. The object
of his visit was of a military character, as he
had been invited by the Government to prepare a
scheme of defence for the Dominion. Lord Kitchener
was received with enthusiasm, and during his
brief sojourn he inspected the harbour defences,
and reviewed 4000 cadets in the Domain.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder and Chief of
the Boy Scouts, came to Auckland in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with this movement. He arrived on May 28th, 1912,
and received a civic welcome from the citizens, the
Mayor, Mr. C. J. Parr, presiding. The hero of
Mafeking spent a busy day, which included a review
of 2500 cadets and 500 boy scouts at the
Domain, the Governor, Baron Islington, taking the
salute. In the evening Sir Robert delivered a lecture
at the Town Hall.</p>

<p>Two years later Sir Ian Hamilton, Inspector-General
of the Overseas Forces, came to New Zealand
in an official capacity. He arrived in Auckland
on May 12th, 1914, for the purpose of
inspecting the military stations in the district, and
the day following reviewed 4000 senior cadets at
the Domain. He was accorded a civic reception,
Mr. A. J. Entrican, Acting-Mayor, officiating.</p>

<p>During the same year two Australian statesmen
visited the Dominion on official business. Mr.
W. A. Holman, Premier of New South Wales,
arrived in Auckland on February 9th, and Mr.
Andrew Fisher, Premier of the Commonwealth of
Australia, on December 28th, 1914.</p>

</div>

<p>In the last twenty years the Waitemata has re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>ceived
a number of visits from various navies, the
first of which was made by the Australian Squadron,
which arrived in the harbour on February
28th, 1903, under the command of Vice-Admiral
Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe. The warships comprising
the squadron were the <i>Royal Arthur</i> (flagship),
<i>Ringarooma</i>, <i>Wallaroo</i>, <i>Phoebe</i>, <i>Archer</i>,
<i>Karrakatta</i>, <i>Sparrow</i>, <i>Lizard</i> and <i>Penguin</i>. The
fleet remained for a week in the harbour, and
during its stay the annual fleet regatta took place.
While on this visit, Admiral Fanshawe declined
the offer of the use of Admiralty House, which had
been erected by the Harbour Board at a cost of
over £8500, including land.</p>

<p>The visit of the United States Navy, in 1908, was
one of the gayest and most spectacular events in
the history of Auckland. The fleet reached Auckland
on Sunday morning, August 9th, and the
Admiral and his men were welcomed by crowds
estimated at 100,000 persons, who utilised every
vantage point on the harbour front. The city and
harbour were decorated in a most extensive manner,
the illuminations, in which electricity was used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
for the first time, being particularly elaborate. The
official landing of Rear-Admiral Sperry and his
officers took place on Monday, when they were
received by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. G.
Ward; members of the Legislature; the Mayor
(Mr. Arthur M. Myers), and members of the City
Council; the chairman (Hon. E. Mitchelson), and
members of the Harbour Board, and others.</p>

<p>Thereafter a week of festivities, the like of which
the city had never previously indulged in, took
place, including banquets, receptions on land and
aboard the ships of the fleet, reviews, race meetings
and sports, both general and aquatic. Public
and private organisations vied with each other in
the entertainment of both officers and men. The
population joined in all these proceedings, and
made the occasion memorable for the visitors and
a pleasure to themselves. &ldquo;Fleet Week,&rdquo; the name
by which the event is now generally referred to,
ended on August 15th, on which date the fleet
steamed out of the harbour.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>New Zealand</i>, a battle cruiser of 18,800
tons, which was presented by the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
New Zealand to the Home Government, arrived, on
a visit, in Auckland Harbour on April 29th, 1913,
with Captain Lionel Halsey in command. The
vessel and its crew received a great welcome from
the citizens, and while in port she was visited by
94,616 persons. In the Great War the ship took
part in the sea fights of Heligoland, Dogger Bank
and Jutland. After the close of the war the battle
cruiser revisited Auckland, on September 23rd,
1919, with Admiral Lord Jellicoe, who was engaged
upon a report on Empire defence, in command.
Another great welcome was accorded both
ship and the distinguished sailor, who the year
following returned to New Zealand as Governor-General.
He made his first visit to Auckland
in a gubernatorial capacity on October 30th,
1920.</p>

<p>During the war period two Japanese warships,
<i>Iwate</i> and <i>Azuma</i> visited New Zealand, arriving
here on July 9th, 1916. Admiral Matsumura, his
officers, and the cadets who manned the ships, were
received by the civic authorities, and were entertained
during their stay in port. Both ships had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
seen service in the Great War, but were now being
used as training ships.</p>

<p>Fires are the commonplace events of a city&rsquo;s
history, and every city&rsquo;s records are full of these
occurrences. During the twenty years under review
large fires alone, <i>i.e.</i>, those causing damage to the
extent of £10,000, destroyed property to the value
of over half a million sterling. The first of these
took place on January 13th, 1901, and completely
destroyed three large buildings in Commerce and
Customs Streets, and damaged two others. The
principal losers by the fire were Messrs. Bond and
Bell, L. D. Nathan and Co. (bond store), and G.
W. Owen and Co. The origin of the fire was unknown,
but owing to the inflammable nature of the
goods in stock, the flames soon obtained a firm
hold of the buildings, and in three hours had entirely
consumed them. The loss sustained in the
fire amounted to £90,000 (estimated). The Fire
Brigades were unfit to cope with so large a conflagration,
on account of the inadequacy of their
appliances, although the water pressure was all that
was required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>A characteristic of the fires which had occurred
in Auckland up to this time was that, with one
exception, no lives had been lost. The Grand
Hotel fire of May 31st, 1901, was unfortunately
responsible for the death of five persons&mdash;three
children and two adults. The building was burned
out, only the walls remaining. The damage was
approximately £12,000.</p>

<p>A disastrous outbreak of fire took place on 4th
May, 1904, in the warehouse belonging to Messrs.
T. and S. Morrin, High Street, practically gutting
the building and destroying a valuable stock of
ironmongery. The damage was estimated to be in
excess of £50,000. A number of firemen were injured
by the collapse of a wall. After this fire
had been brought under control, another outbreak
in the retail premises of the same firm, which stood
on the other side of High Street. Fortunately, it
was confined to the roof.</p>

<p>The City Chambers, situated at the corner of
Queen and Victoria Streets, was destroyed by fire
in the early part of the evening of June 21st, 1906.
All the storeys except the first were destroyed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
damage to the building amounted to considerably
over £10,000, and the loss on stock was also considerable,
but difficult to ascertain, as the Chambers
were rented as offices and occupied by many people.</p>

<p>Another serious fire, causing damage estimated
at £100,000, destroyed the four-storeyed building
in Queen Street, known as the Strand Arcade, on
August 16th, 1909. So intense were the flames
that in two hours the building, which had only been
erected eight years, was reduced to a heap of ruins.
It was due to the energies of the Fire Brigades that
the hotels on either side of the Arcade were not
involved in the conflagration.</p>

<p>One of the biggest fires ever experienced in
Auckland broke out a few minutes before eleven
o&rsquo;clock on November 16th, 1911, in the premises
of Messrs. Macky, Logan, Caldwell and Co., Elliott
Street. The outbreak was first observed at the
Darby Street end of the building, but in a very
short time the whole front, from Darby Street to
Victoria Street, was in flames. As a spectacle, it
was one of the grandest fires seen in the city. It
burned so fiercely that fears were entertained that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the whole block, which is bounded by Queen Street,
would be involved. A right-of-way in Darby Street,
combined with the efforts of the firemen, however,
stayed the course of the fire, and in less than three
hours the outbreak was under control, but not
before damage estimated at £150,000 had been
caused.</p>

<p>On 29th March, 1913, Endean&rsquo;s Buildings, at
the corner of Queen and Quay Streets, were
destroyed by fire. The damage was estimated at
£35,000.</p>

<p>A fire which took place on October 23rd, 1915,
at the stables of Messrs. J. J. Craig Ltd., Parnell,
totally destroyed the building, and caused the death
of more than two hundred horses. So speedily did
the fire spread that only two animals escaped alive.</p>

<p>The fire on February 6th, 1917, which occurred
in Gleeson&rsquo;s Buildings, High Street, was peculiar
in respect of the amount of damage to goods in
relation to the damage which the building sustained.
Cinematograph films, stated to be worth £28,000,
belonging to the Amalgamated Film Exchange
of Australia (whose representatives occupied floors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in this building), were destroyed. The damage to
the building did not exceed £1000.</p>

<p>Two outbreaks of fire took place at Messrs. Bycroft
Ltd., Shortland Street within a month of one
another. The first occurred on February 6th, 1919,
gutting the part of the building fronting Shortland
Street, and causing damage estimated at £15,000.
The second fire broke out on March 8th in the rear
portion of the building, destroying it and causing
injury to the machinery. The damage on this occasion
was about £12,000.</p>

<p>Another fire, which had fatal results, was the
Thames Hotel blaze of February 19th, 1919. Two
storeys were gutted, and one of the guests was
burned to death. Others received injuries while
escaping from the burning building.</p>

<p>The most serious wreck of this period connected
with the Port of Auckland was the disaster which
overtook the Huddart-Parker steamer <i>Elingamite</i>
(2585 tons), which was totally wrecked on the
Three Kings, while on a voyage from Sydney to
Auckland, on November 9th, 1902. The vessel,
which was travelling slowly on account of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
thick fog, had no warning of her danger, and when
she struck, the engines were reversed without delay,
but she had stuck fast. The boats and rafts were
immediately launched, and all aboard, except the
captain and chief steward, were taken off. Only
one boat, however, reached the mainland, while
others managed to make the Big King and the
Middle King. The survivors on these islands underwent
some hardships, until rescued by the steamer
<i>Zealandia</i>, which had been intercepted by the
master of a whaling boat, who conveyed the news
of the disaster to the captain of that vessel. Later
a raft was picked up by H.M.S. <i>Penguin</i>, but only
eight out of sixteen found on it were alive. The
survivors had undergone four days of terrible sufferings.
One boat load of passengers was completely
lost without trace. The total number of
lives lost through the wreck was forty-nine.</p>

<p>A shipwreck of a more local character was the
disaster which overtook the <i>Kapanui</i> inside the
Heads on December 23rd, 1905. About nine
o&rsquo;clock in the evening the coastal steamer <i>Kapanui</i>,
on its homeward voyage from Waiwera, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
rammed by another coaster, the <i>Claymore</i>, outward
bound, between Devonport wharf and North Head.
The <i>Kapanui</i> sunk in a few minutes, five persons
being drowned. The collision was due primarily
to the <i>Kapanui&rsquo;s</i> port light becoming extinguished,
but the Court of Inquiry also found fault with the
captain&rsquo;s handling of the vessel.</p>

<p>Another coastal steamer, the <i>Kia-Ora</i>, while voyaging
to Onehunga, was wrecked at Kawhia, on
June 13th, 1907. Captain J. C. Blacklock and two
passengers were drowned.</p>

<p>An unusual shipping accident occurred in the
Calliope Dock on November 27th, 1906, during
the docking of the Shaw, Savill and Albion
Company&rsquo;s steamer <i>Mamari</i> (7062 tons), which
resulted in the death of two men by drowning,
and the injuring of thirty others. The accident
was caused by the vessel lurching suddenly while
there was still six feet of water in the dock.
This unexpected movement of the ship sent the
water swirling in the dock, taking men and loose
timber with it, and causing the casualties stated.
The ship had to be refloated without delay, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
position she had got into was extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Another Huddart-Parker liner, the <i>Wimmera</i>
(3021 tons), was sunk on June 26th, 1918, off
North Cape, after striking a submerged mine. At
the time of the disaster she was on a voyage from
Auckland to Sydney. After the explosion the life-boats
were lowered, and five of them got safely
away. One of the boats (No. 4) was stoved in against
the ship, and most of its complement perished.
Altogether, ten passengers and sixteen of the crew,
including Captain R. J. Kell, were drowned.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s municipal progress in the last twenty
years has been most marked. The Corporation&rsquo;s
motto, &ldquo;Advance,&rdquo; appears to have been kept in
mind and lived up to, and in no direction was
this activity more noticeable than in the city&rsquo;s
streets. In 1902 Auckland possessed only one
paved street; there are now thirty-three streets laid
in either asphalt, wood blocks, or concrete, as well
as a large number of macadamised roads. The
failure of a supply of good road metal retarded
Auckland&rsquo;s progress in road making, but the substitution
of concrete has had successful results, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the Council has given authority for a large number
of streets to be laid in this material, and the work
is now being proceeded with. Another project which
has engaged the attention of the Corporation was
the widening of narrow streets, in order to carry
the increased traffic which now passes over them.
The improvements are most apparent on the waterfront,
where the co-operation of the Harbour Board
was obtained, and the largest and most costly undertaking
of this class of work was the scheme known
as the eastern outlet. This work necessitated the
purchase of all properties between Beach Road and
Jermyn Street, the widening of the first named
from 66 feet to 110 feet, and the laying down of
a new thoroughfare, named Anzac Avenue, 84 feet
wide, from Beach Road to Lower Symonds Street.
The making of this new highway was commenced
in 1915, and the trams commenced running on it
in February, 1921.</p>

</div>

<p>The opening, in 1910, of the Grafton Bridge,
which is constructed in ferro-concrete, and is
notable as having the longest three-hinged arch in
the world, was another important undertaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which provided easy access to the Hospital and
Domain, and linked up Parnell and Newmarket
with the western districts of the city.</p>

<p>The provision of parks in, and adjacent to, the
city was another feature of this time. At the
beginning of the period the only parks in the city
were the Domain (194 acres), Albert Park (14
acres), and Western Park (6 acres). In 1901, on
completion of the reclamations, Victoria Park (18
acres) was leased from the Harbour Board, and
has been formed into an excellent sports and recreation
ground, containing a children&rsquo;s playing area,
which has recently been equipped by Mr. John
Court. Point Erin Park, Ponsonby (12 acres) was
acquired ten years later, and soon after the amalgamation
of Parnell with the city, the Corporation
acquired the Gillies property and &ldquo;Kilbryde,&rdquo; formerly
the residence of the late Sir John Logan
Campbell, which adjoined. These two properties
united were opened in 1915 and named Parnell
Park (9 acres). In the same year Myers Park (6
acres) was opened. This park, which was presented
by Mr. (afterwards the Hon.) A. M. Myers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in 1913, was originally an unsightly gully, overgrown
with weeds; it has been transformed into a
delightful and useful reserve, where one was much
needed. At a later date Mr. Myers erected in the
park (which has been equipped especially for
children&rsquo;s play) a free kindergarten. The building,
which was designed by Messrs. Chilwell and
Trevithick, and built by Messrs. Johns and Sons,
was formally opened by the Governor, Lord Liverpool,
on November 15th, 1916. Its cost, exclusive
of equipment, was £5666. Three other parks,
which lie outside the city boundary, on the shores
of the Manukau Harbour, were also added to the
city&rsquo;s reserves by the generosity of various donors.
Cornwallis Park (1927 acres) was bequeathed
under the will of the late J. Mitchell McLachlan
in 1911; Atkinson Park (30 acres) was the gift
of the late H. W. Atkinson, two years later;
and Kaiterakihe Park (761 acres) was presented
by Mr. Wesley Spragg in 1918. Waiatarua Park
(156 acres) is another large reserve, undeveloped
at present, which the Council acquired by purchase,
with a view to the future needs of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Another form of recreation which the city has
made provision for is swimming, and up-to-date
outdoor baths have been erected at Shelly Beach
(150ft. × 60ft.), and at Point Resolution, Parnell
(194ft. × 149ft.). The former was opened in 1912
and the latter in 1914. The Hobson Street Tepid
Baths, which are indoor baths, were constructed at
a cost of £10,673 by Messrs. J. T. Julian and Sons,
and were opened on December 17th, 1914. There
are two ponds (100ft. × 50ft. and 60ft. × 30ft.), as
well as private baths, dressing rooms, laundry, etc.</p>

<p>Some large engineering works have also been
carried out during these years. The Waitakere
dam, which stores 220,000,000 gallons of water,
was finished in 1906. Two other reservoirs are
under construction at Nihotupu, the upper designed
to contain 69,000,000 gallons of water, and the
main dam 540,000,000 gallons. The smaller dam
is expected to be completed shortly, and the
large one in 1923. A comprehensive scheme of
drainage and sewerage for the city and suburbs
was started on 25th October, 1909, and the main
outfall works were opened on March 25th, 1914.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
The work of linking up other districts has proceeded
during the following years. Electrical
supply for power and lighting was taken in hand
by the Corporation in 1906, and the first supply
was given from Freeman&rsquo;s Bay in 1908. Since
that date the department has grown considerably,
although the war interfered with the supply of material
and delayed the development of the scheme.
An idea of the present extent of the undertaking
may be formed from the fact that for the year
ending 31st March, 1921, 10,496,060 units were
sold, the revenue being £108,734. The electric
tramway system was inaugurated on 24th November,
1902, powers having been given to a company
for this purpose. The City Council took over the
concern on July 1st, 1919. There are at present
twenty-seven miles of lines and 154 cars in commission.
For the year ending 31st March, 1921,
the cars carried 45,820,939 persons.</p>

<p>Other activities which engaged the attention of
the Council were the erection of new abattoirs at
Westfield (opened in 1909), and large new city
markets, which were completed in 1917 and 1918.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
The Corporation also entered the fish trade, opening
markets and providing trawlers to catch fish,
and, besides supplying the trade, it retails this food
at its own shop. The figures of last year&rsquo;s working
indicate the extent of this business. The total weight
of fish received from all sources was 1040 tons,
the sales amounting to £49,758.</p>

<p>The provision of houses by the municipality was
commenced in 1915, when six houses were erected
in Ponsonby. A larger scheme of dwellings, to be
erected on the old abattoir site at Grey Lynn, was
proposed in 1918, but, owing to financial difficulties,
it could not be carried out. As an instalment
of the proposal, ten cottages have been built on
this site up to the present.</p>

<p class="caption">
The Town Hall, with the Sir George Grey Statue</p>
</div>

<p>The erection of the Town Hall, which commenced
in 1908, was significant of the position
which the municipality had now attained. The
question of a Town Hall had been under consideration
from 1880, but until this time the Council had
not been in a position to do anything. Prior to the
opening of the Town Hall, the Council&rsquo;s staff had
no settled headquarters, the first Council offices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
under the present constitution being located in
rooms over Messrs. Upton and Co.&rsquo;s book shop,
Queen Street. As the Council&rsquo;s affairs increased,
further accommodation was found necessary, and
the old Magistrate&rsquo;s Court, at the corner of High
and Chancery Streets, was obtained to meet the
requirements. After the opening of the Public
Library and Art Gallery, the Council utilised some
of the rooms in this building as municipal chambers,
and here the Council&rsquo;s work was carried on
until the Town Hall was ready for occupation.</p>

<p>The foundation stone of the Town Hall was laid
by the Mayor, Mr. A. M. Myers, on the 24th February,
1909, and the building was opened by the
Governor, Baron Islington, on the 14th December,
1911, Mr. C. J. Parr, Mayor, presiding at the ceremony
which took place in the large hall. The festivities
connected with the opening continued for
a week, concerts, organ recitals, oratorios, and the
annual reunion of the Old Colonists&rsquo; Association
being held in the new hall. The building was designed
by Messrs. J. J. and E. J. Clark, of Melbourne,
and the contractors were Messrs. Ferguson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and Malcolm, of Auckland, whose contract for the
work was £87,565.</p>

<p>The building is divided into two portions, one
being devoted to administrative purposes, including
the Council Chamber, and the other comprising the
halls, of which there are two, with a supper room
and ante-rooms. The large hall has seating accommodation
for 2700, and the orchestral platform and
chorus galleries can seat 350 performers. The Concert
Chamber has seating capacity for 880 persons.</p>

<p>At the opening ceremony the Mayor formally
acknowledged two splendid gifts, which had been
made to the citizens and erected in the Town Hall.
These were the pipe organ, the gift of Mr. Henry
Brett, and the clock, which was presented by Mr.
A. M. Myers.</p>

<p>The finances of the city show clearly the present
position of municipal affairs, and the development
which has been made in the last two decades. The
city&rsquo;s annual valuation in 1901 was £349,765;
to-day it stands at £1,497,095. The Council&rsquo;s
revenue at the same date was £1,077,047, compared
with £82,657 twenty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>The spirit of civic progress was not confined to
the municipal authority for the Harbour Board
also embarked upon a huge programme of work,
which is still going on, and which has completely
transformed the waterfront, making it one of the
most up-to-date ports in Australasia. It even permeated
to individuals, as the record of benefactions
amply demonstrates. Some of these benefactions
have already been mentioned, but others remain to
be described.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. A. Mackechnie, who died on November
7th, 1902, bequeathed by direction of her deceased
husband, to the Auckland Institute and Museum
the sum of £2500, of which £2000 was to endow
a library and £500 to purchase cases of animals.
A similar amount, £2500 was left to the Auckland
Society of Arts to erect a gallery. The Institute
received also by this bequest the late Mr. Mackechnie&rsquo;s
library.</p>

<p>The Leys Institute was founded by the will of
the late William Leys, who died on the 5th October,
1899. The funds available being inadequate
for the early realisation of the testator&rsquo;s benevolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
purpose, Mr. Thomson W. Leys, a brother of the
deceased, and one of his trustees, offered to defray
one-half of the entire cost of erecting and equipping
a building, and to furnish the institution with
a library, on condition that the Corporation provided
a suitable site. This condition was readily
agreed to by the City Council, and on the 29th
March, 1905, the institution was officially opened
by the Mayor, the Hon. E. Mitchelson. Mr. R. M.
Watts was the architect, and the cost of erecting
and equipping the building, exclusive of books,
was £3234. The Leys Institute consists of a reference
library and reading room, a lending department,
boys&rsquo; room and recreation rooms. The course
of winter lectures and entertainments has been a
feature of its work since the commencement. The
gymnasium has recently been converted into a large
boys&rsquo; hall, probably the largest boys&rsquo; institute in
the Dominion. Mr. T. W. Leys has been president
of the institute since its inception, and its success
is due mainly to his personal interest and benefactions.</p>

<p>Charitable institutions were also fortunate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
assistance they received from benefactors. By the
will of the late William Arrowsmith, who died in
1902, a sum of about £23,000 was bequeathed, in
equal parts, to the Orphans&rsquo; Home and Mrs. Cowie&rsquo;s
Women&rsquo;s Home.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Smith presented in March,
1907 to the Hospital Board a property at Russell
Crescent, Ellerslie, containing over three acres and
a two-storey dwelling, formerly the home of the
donors, for the purpose of founding a convalescent
home for women and children, which was named
the Alexandra Convalescent Home. At the time
the gift was made the estate was valued at about
£5000.</p>

<p>A number of Auckland institutions benefited by
the will of Mrs. Knox, widow of the late Charles
Knox, both pioneers, who arrived in New Zealand
in the &rsquo;forties. Mrs. Knox died on the 19th October,
1908, bequeathing £70,000 to charities, including
£20,000 for the erection of a building for
the treatment of poor people suffering from incurable
diseases. This institution, which bears the
donor&rsquo;s name, is situated at Tamaki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The Leslie Presbyterian Orphanage was opened
on the 21st October, 1911, although the bequest of
£3485 of Mr. James Leslie, the founder of the institution,
was made known at his death on 15th
November, 1888. For some years after the date of
the bequest the trustees did not feel justified in
erecting a building, on account of the small sum
at their disposal, but with the addition of £1000
bequeathed by Mrs. Birrell, and the bequest of
Mrs. Knox of £500, they decided to carry out the
original testator&rsquo;s will. The home, which is situated
on the harbour at Meadow Bank, was designed
by the late E. Bartley, the builder being
Mr. O. E. Farrow.</p>

<p>The Auckland Exhibition of 1913, which was
officially opened on 1st December, 1913, by the
Governor, the Earl of Liverpool, was a striking
proof of the commercial and industrial advancement
of the city and province. The opening ceremony
was attended by a most representative
gathering, including the Prime Minister (Rt. Hon.
W. F. Massey), members of Parliament, and
mayors and municipal representatives from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
whole Dominion. On the Governor&rsquo;s arrival at the
Exhibition grounds, he was received by Mr. George
Elliot, chairman, and members of the Exhibition
Executive, the Mayor of Auckland (Mr. C. J.
Parr), and others. In the evening the Corporation
gave a banquet to the distinguished visitors, at
which the Mayor presided. In this manner the exhibition
was inaugurated. The exhibition grounds
occupied an area of 48 acres of the Domain, and
the cost of erecting the buildings and laying out
the grounds was £30,000.</p>

<p>Generally, the exhibition was run on conventional
lines, being principally of an industrial and
commercial character. Special features were introduced
as far as Auckland was concerned, the
principal one being the engagement of the Band
of the Royal Regiment of Artillery of 45 performers,
under the command of Captain N. P. R.
Preston, with Mr. C. E. Stretton, musical director,
this being the first occasion on which one of the
great regimental bands of the British Army had
visited New Zealand. The enterprise shown in
bringing out the Royal Artillery Band was repaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
by the financial success which resulted, due in
great measure to this attraction. The amusements
provided in the exhibition, while not new to Auckland,
were on a larger scale than had hitherto been
attempted, and occupied 15 acres, named Wonderland
Park. The art section contained a collection
of 600 paintings, etc., collected and brought out
to New Zealand from London by Mr. John Baillie,
formerly of Wellington. The illumination by electricity
of the buildings and grounds by night was
another interesting and beautiful feature.</p>

<p>The exhibition remained open till April 18th,
1914, and during the four and a half months of
its life it was estimated that 870,000 people visited
it. From the social and business aspects the exhibition
was a great success, and after expenses
had been met a sum of £21,758 remained as profit.
It had previously been decided that any surplus
accruing from the exhibition should be used in
beautifying the Domain, and this sum of money
has since been expended on improvements carried
out on the outer Domain, including the laying-out
of paths, flower beds, playing areas, and the erec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>tion
of the winter-garden, which stands on the site
of one of the exhibition buildings. The tea kiosk
and the bandstand, near the main drive, are permanent
survivals of the exhibition.</p>

<p>The principal officials were: Mr. George Elliot,
chairman of executive; Messrs. Bamford and
Pierce, architects; Mr. E. A. Pearce, supervisor of
buildings, etc.; and Mr. W. R. Holmes, manager.
Mr. Holmes, it is interesting to note, had filled
the same position in the exhibition of 1898-9.</p>

<p>Another banking establishment was added to the
number of these institutions in 1913, the Commercial
Bank of Australia opening a branch in Shortland
Street in October of that year, but later the
business was removed to premises in Queen Street.</p>

<p>The principal overseas shipping of the port was
brought up to 1909 in the previous section. For
the two following years Auckland did not receive
much consideration as a port of call for the trans-Pacific
steamers, but in 1911 the Union Company
reinstated Auckland as the way port in the Sydney-Vancouver
service, the <i>Marama</i> (6437 tons) taking
up the run, and arriving at Auckland on August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
5th. The <i>Makura</i> (8200 tons) and the <i>Zealandia</i>
(now the <i>Paloona</i>, 2771 tons) were also commissioned
for this service. In April, 1913 the <i>Niagara</i>
(13,415 tons) replaced the <i>Zealandia</i>, and the
<i>Marama</i> was withdrawn in July, 1914, since when
the <i>Niagara</i> and <i>Makura</i> have maintained the running
between Australia and Canada.</p>

<p>The P. &amp; O. Company established a service to
New Zealand <i>via</i> Suez Canal in 1910, the Mongolia
arriving in Auckland on November 23rd. With the
sailing of the <i>Macedonia</i>, on April 12th, 1913, the
service was discontinued.</p>

<p>The latest line of steamers to inaugurate a New
Zealand service is the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine, Ltd., the first steamer of this line to
reach Auckland being the <i>Canadian Raider</i>, which
arrived on 3rd April, 1920. The undertaking is
interesting, having been created by the Canadian
Government with the purpose of extending the commerce
of that dominion. The steamers, which are
designed to carry general and refrigerated cargo,
number seventy, and trade to all parts of the world
<i>via</i> the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, monthly calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
being made at Auckland, where the head office for
Australasia is situated. The marine service is
worked in conjunction with the Canadian National
and Grand Trunk railway systems.</p>

<p>The inter-colonial service has been carried on
regularly by the Huddart-Parker and the Union
lines, while the latter has practically gained a
monopoly of the inter-provincial and the Island
services.</p>

</div>

<p>An industrial disturbance, which ended in a
general strike, paralysing the trade of the Dominion,
occurred at the end of 1913. The trouble
began with the miners in 1912, but the strikes of
the Wellington shipwrights and the Huntly miners,
which took place simultaneously in October, 1913,
brought out other trades, including the waterside
workers, and for some weeks the commerce and
industry of the Dominion were at a standstill. Even
the city trams ceased running. After a fortnight,
free labour became available and rapidly grew in
extent. Within a month the city became normal.
One of the features of the strike was the introduction
of special police, who were enlisted to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the free labourers. The Auckland special police
included over 800 mounted men, who camped in
the Domain. Although feeling between the unionists
and the strike-breakers ran high, there was no
conflict at any time.</p>

<p>During the following years there were a number
of industrial disputes, but in the war period
strikes were not resorted to. The &ldquo;go-slow&rdquo; policy
was, however, introduced during the later stages
of the war, and caused considerable inconvenience.
In 1919 the strike reappeared and coal supplies
became so short that public conveniences, such as
gas and electricity, were affected, and their curtailment
became frequent. The railway services
were also affected, only the briefest time-tables
being carried out. In 1920 complete suspension
of both trams and gas supplies occurred, owing to
lack of fuel. On two occasions the trams ceased
running&mdash;from January 31st to February 13th, and
from September 25th to October 11th. Almost simultaneously
with the second suspension of the trams
the gas supply was entirely stopped, the period
being from September 30th until October 14th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Another strike, which was not appreciated by
the public, was the butchers&rsquo; strike, which lasted
from November 15th to December 6th, 1919.</p>

<p>The jockeys&rsquo; strike, which took place at the
Avondale races on April 10th, 1920, was a small
affair in itself, and would not merit mention if it
were not for the events which followed it. On
June 3rd the tramwaymen detailed for duty on the
race cars refused to run the &ldquo;race specials&rdquo; and
were suspended. The other tramwaymen, out of
sympathy with these men, ran their cars into the
depôts. The City Council, which had taken over
the system from the Auckland Tramway Company,
considered that the men had struck, and the service
was not resumed until June 8th, when the dispute
was settled.</p>

<p>Between the jockeys&rsquo; strike and its sequel&mdash;the
tramways dispute&mdash;the railwaymen came out, on
account of dissatisfaction with their conditions.
The strike commenced on April 27th, and the dispute
threatened to be a most serious affair. It
lasted for less than a week, the men returning to
duty on May 2nd. If the dispute had not been thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
speedily settled, the results, both economic and
commercial, would have been disastrous to the
community. This event took place when the Prince
of Wales had just commenced his tour of New Zealand.
He was then at Rotorua, but the men on the
train agreed to bring the Royal visitor back to
Auckland. This unscheduled hold-up of the tour
was taken in a philosophic spirit by His Royal
Highness.</p>

<p>The European War, which fell on the world with
such suddenness, soon became felt on this side of
the globe. The report at first brought consternation
to New Zealanders, with which was mingled the
usual display of patriotic ardour. Bands of youths
and young men paraded Queen Street, singing
patriotic songs and demonstrating. To many business
people the idea of war spelt ruin, and many
of them immediately curtailed their staffs. Within
a very short time&mdash;a fortnight at most&mdash;these extreme
expressions of the public mind settled down,
and the true feelings of the community found vent.
The New Zealand Government at once offered
Great Britain its assistance, which was as speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
accepted. On August 10th the first portion of
Auckland volunteers for overseas service left for
Wellington, to join the other units which formed
the advance party of the N.Z.E.F. for the Samoan
expedition. From this onwards there were regular
concentrations of men for the forces, and at intervals
the troops left for the seat of war.</p>

<p>The embarkations were usually made from Wellington,
but in the earlier days of the war the
troops sometimes left from other ports, including
Auckland. One of the most memorable send-offs
to outgoing troops took place on September
23rd, 1914, when 2000 soldiers paraded at
the Auckland Domain, and were ceremonially
farewelled by the citizens, the Prime Minister
(the Rt. Hon. W. F. Massey) and the Mayor
(Mr. C. J. Parr, C.M.G.) addressing the men.
A similar event took place on the occasion of
the embarkation of the Second Maori Reinforcements,
on 17th September, 1915. This departure
was an impressive spectacle, as the older
Maoris and their women-folk carried out the
ceremony in traditional manner. The Mayor (Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
J. H. Gunson) presided at the ceremony, which
took place outside the Town Hall.</p>

<p>In the first months of the war a training camp
for local recruits was located at Epsom, but as the
Dominion&rsquo;s military organisation developed, this
camp was abandoned, and the Auckland recruits
went direct to Trentham or one of the other concentration
camps. The only permanent camp in the
Auckland district was at Narrow Neck, Devonport,
where the Maoris and recruits from the South Seas
underwent their course of training.</p>

<p>Apart from the unusual number of men in khaki,
and the economic conditions brought into being by
the war, New Zealand was scarcely disturbed. The
economic factors have been mentioned in another
part of this narrative, and, although serious while
they lasted, they could not be described as hardships,
such as were experienced by people living
nearer the war zones.</p>

<p>The most exciting event which occurred near
Auckland during the war was the escape of Commander
von Luckner and ten other German prisoners
of war on December 13th, 1917, from in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ternment
at Motuihi. They seized the motor launch
belonging to the camp commandant, and then commandeered
the scow <i>Moa</i> at sea. They were recaptured
near the Kermadec Islands on December
21st and brought back to Auckland on Boxing
Day, on board the cable ship <i>Iris</i>.</p>

<p>The discovery of a submarine minefield between
North Cape and Cape Maria van Diemen was
another incident, which was followed by fatal
results. Shipping was notified on June 11th, 1918,
to avoid the locality. Unfortunately, the steamer
<i>Wimmera</i> neglected to observe the instructions, and
became a victim, as related elsewhere in this section.</p>

<p>Apart from the number of soldiers which New
Zealand sent to the war, the people of the Dominion
entered with enthusiasm into the work arising out
of the war and the relief of the sufferers thereby.
Associations, in which both young and old laboured
with good results, were formed. The dull days of
war were enlivened from time to time by carnivals
and special days for the Red Cross, Blue Cross,
the Servian and Belgian relief funds, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
patriotic purposes. In connection with the Belgian
fund, Mr. H. E. Partridge presented, in March
1915, the collection of Maori paintings by Mr. G.
Lindauer, to the Auckland Art Gallery, on condition
that the people of Auckland district subscribed
£10,000. The condition was fulfilled within a very
short period. On October 14th of the same year
the Auckland Queen Carnival, organised by the
Auckland Patriotic and War Relief Association,
was started. The respective supporters of the twelve
queens worked with great assiduity, and by November
29th, when the coronation of Mrs. Bollard
(Queen of the South), the winner, took place, the
proceeds from this effort totalled £264,547.</p>

<p>The Auckland Patriotic League, which afterwards
became the Auckland Provincial Patriotic
and War Relief Association, was formed in the
first month of the war, the Mayor of Auckland
being chairman <i>ex officio</i>. Mr. C. J. Parr was the
first chairman, occupying the position from August,
1914, to April, 1915, when he was succeeded by
Mr. J. H. Gunson, who has held the position up
to the present. In recognition of his services to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
this and other patriotic endeavours, including
the work which he did on the National Efficiency
Board<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he was made an officer of the Order
of the British Empire (O.B.E.) in 1918, and
in the following year was elevated to the commandership
of the Order (C.B.E.). The Mayoress
(Mrs. Gunson) was also made an officer of the
same Order, in acknowledgement of her patriotic
work.</p>

<p>The total funds collected by the Patriotic and
War Relief Association from the 10th August,
1914, until the end of September, 1921, including
interest, amounted to over half a million sterling.</p>

<p>The official peace celebrations were held on July
19th, 1919. A universal holiday was observed,
and the city wore a gala appearance, bunting and
decorations being everywhere in evidence. The
official part of the proceedings commenced with a
procession, which formed at the foot of Queen
Street, and travelled to the Domain. In the procession
the men who had served in the war took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
pride of place. The official, consular and civil life
of the city was also represented. Next to the soldiers,
in point of interest, were the various local
organisations which had taken part in the work
connected with the war and patriotic endeavour.
Many of these associations were represented by
members who wore symbolic costumes and were
conveyed in tastefully decorated vehicles, adding
a picturesque touch to the procession.</p>

<p>At the Domain the troops, of which some 5500
were on parade, marched past the saluting base,
Colonel H. R. Potter, C.M.G., officer commanding
the district, taking the salute. At the conclusion of
the military function the Deputy-Mayor (Mr. A. J.
Entrican) read the King&rsquo;s message, after which a
salute of twenty-one guns was fired. The returned
soldiers were then entertained to lunch by the Peace
Celebrations Committee.</p>

<p>At night the city was transformed into a carnival.
Bonfires were lit, and the spirit of revelry
was abroad, but owing to the coal shortage only
limited illuminations were permitted.</p>

<p>The welcome accorded to the soldiers returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to New Zealand after hostilities had ceased was
usually of a private character, being confined to
relatives. The civic heads and other officials were
present, and on behalf of the citizens welcomed the
soldiers home. An exception to this, however, was
made on the return of the Maori Battalion, numbering
1000 strong, on April 6th, 1919. The occasion
was made a great festival by the natives, and
representatives from every tribe in New Zealand
were congregated at Auckland to take part in the
welcome, which was conducted in accordance with
Maori custom. The gathering was held in the
Auckland Domain, and the day being a Sunday
a great assemblage of the public collected there to
take part in the welcome home. It was the greatest
Maori ceremonial gathering which had been held
in New Zealand since the Maori ceremonies attending
the visit to Rotorua of the Duke and Duchess
of York, in 1901. Native dances were performed,
and speeches of welcome made by the chiefs of the
various tribes. On behalf of the white people of
New Zealand, the Maori soldiers were welcomed
home by Sir James Allen, Minister for Defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Mr. J. H. Gunson, Mayor of Auckland, Hon. Sir James
Carroll, K.C.M.G., M.P., and others. After the formal reception,
the Maoris partook of a feast in native
fashion.</p>

<p>Shortly after the conclusion of hostilities a
French mission, representative of the national,
economic and commercial interests of France, with
General Pau, the famous soldier, who had served
in the war, at its head, visited New Zealand, and
arrived at Auckland on December 27th, 1918. The
object of the visit was to thank the Government
and people for the services rendered by New Zealand
in the war, and to study how inter-commercial
relations could be extended. On the mission&rsquo;s
return to Auckland from the South, the members
were accorded a civic reception on January 24th,
the Mayor (Mr. J. H. Gunson) presiding.</p>

<p>During 1919 and 1920 two distinguished soldiers,
who were intimately connected with the New
Zealand forces which had served overseas, were
given cordial welcome to Auckland. The first to
arrive in the city was Brigadier-General G. S.
Richardson, who had held the position of Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>mandant
of the New Zealand Forces in England,
during the period that the New Zealanders served
in France. He reached Auckland on May 5th,
1919, and his reception was in the nature of a
welcome home, as he had been connected with the
New Zealand Forces for many years before the
outbreak of hostilities.</p>

<p>General Sir William Riddell Birdwood, who
commanded the Australian and New Zealand Division
on Gallipoli, and gained a great reputation
among the troops under his care, arrived in Auckland
on July 6th, 1920. He was given an enthusiastic
reception by returned soldiers and the general
public. The city tendered him a reception at the
Town Hall, at which the Mayor (Mr. J. H. Gunson)
again presided.</p>

<p>The Soldiers&rsquo; Club was opened on September
13th, 1915, in rooms of the Y.M.C.A., which were
loaned by the directors. As larger numbers of
repatriated soldiers came back to Auckland, the
accommodation at the Y.M.C.A. became insufficient,
and new premises for the club were found in Albert
Street, which were opened on 20th October, 1920.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The most serious epidemic of disease ever experienced
in Auckland was the outbreak of influenza,
which occurred in October, 1918. The
account of the epidemic given in the &ldquo;Auckland
and Charitable Aid Board: a History&rdquo; is the best
account the writer has seen, and he therefore makes
no apology for quoting from it. &ldquo;Influenza in a
somewhat unusual form was prevalent in the city
from the early part of October ... but the worst
phases dated from a fortnight after the arrival of
the R.M.S. <i>Niagara</i> from Vancouver, on the 12th
of the month.... On the berthing of the vessel
in Auckland, twenty-eight men were removed to
the Hospital and placed in an isolation ward.
Within a few days the disease was communicated
to members of the Hospital staff. Simultaneously
it spread to the community.... The insufficiency
of the ordinary hospital accommodation to meet
the demands of such an extraordinary emergency
were early apparent. Temporary hospitals were
accordingly established at the Seddon Memorial
Technical College, &ldquo;Kilbryde&rdquo; (Point Resolution),
the Sailors&rsquo; Home, the Avondale racecourse build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>ings,
Myers Kindergarten, the Y.W.C.A. hostel,
Vermont Street schools, and St. Joseph&rsquo;s schoolroom,
Grey Lynn. The Auckland Racing Club&rsquo;s
buildings at Ellerslie were converted into a temporary
convalescent home.... Rigorous measures
were taken at the beginning of November to limit
the spread of the disease. Business in the city was
brought almost to a standstill. Places of amusement
and worship, banks, schools, hotel bars, and
many warehouses were closed; public meetings
... were forbidden; such facilities as the telegraphic,
telephonic, railway and shipping services
were curtailed, and all classes of the community
united in the supreme work of meeting [combating]
the scourge.... The visitation was at its
height in the first two weeks of November....
By the middle of November it was evident that the
progress of the disease had been stayed, and from
that time onward it gradually diminished in severity
until by the end of the month only isolated
cases remained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The official statistics of the deaths for the Auckland
registration district during the period of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
epidemic was 1013, or 7.57 per thousand of the
population. The largest number of deaths recorded
in one day was 56.</p>

<p>On November 8th an announcement of the signing
of the Armistice was received in Auckland,
which later proved to have been premature. Despite
the epidemic, which was then at its height, the city
went wild with joy, and never were such scenes
enacted as on that morning. When the official intimation
was received, four days later, there was no
demonstration.</p>

<p>Sporting events have not found much space in
these pages, as it would have been difficult to know
where to draw a line on such a subject. Such an
international event as the Davis Cup Challenge
Round, which commenced on December 30th, 1920,
is of such an exceptional nature as to justify its
mention. The choice of New Zealand as the scene
of the final round was in the nature of a compliment
to the brilliant New Zealand exponent of the game,
Anthony Wilding, who lost his life in the Great
War. The games were contested on special courts
prepared in the Auckland Domain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1918 was remarkable for the weather.
There were three severe gales, the first occurring
on February 14th, the next on March 18th, and the
last on June 20th. In the latter the wind blew at
the rate of 440 miles in 24 hours; in the two former
the velocity reached 520 miles. The temperature
during July was extremely low, and in the last
week of the month it dropped to 30 degrees, which
was the lowest temperature recorded for over thirty
years. The severe frost which covered the ground
was an unusual sight for Aucklanders. June, 1920,
was another cold month, and on July 1st the thermometer
at Albert Park registered 29 degrees.</p>

Reception of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales at the Town Hall, April 24th, 1920</p>
</div>

<p>The event which opened this section of Auckland&rsquo;s
annals was the visit of the Duke and Duchess
of Cornwall and York, who are now the reigning
sovereigns. It is fitting, therefore, to close it with
the visit of their son and heir, H.R.H. the Prince
of Wales, in 1920. The visit was the outcome of
a promise made by His Majesty the King that the
Prince would visit the Dominions as a token of
appreciation of the spirit of loyalty and unity
displayed by the whole Empire during the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
H.M.S. <i>Renown</i> (26,500 tons) conveyed the Royal
visitor on his tour, and arrived in the Waitemata
Harbour on April 24th. The voyage from North
Head was a wonderful water pageant, craft of
every sort and size taking part in it. The Prince
first set foot on New Zealand at Auckland, and
was welcomed by the Governor-General (Admiral
Lord Jellicoe), the Prime Minister (the Rt. Hon.
W. F. Massey, P.C.), the Mayor (Mr. J. H.
Gunson), and the Chairman of the Harbour Board
(Mr. H. D. Heather). He then paid an official
call on the Governor-General, and later made a
triumphal journey along Queen Street to the Town
Hall, where the Mayor and citizens formally welcomed
His Royal Highness to the city and delivered
to him a loyal address. In the afternoon a military
review was held in the Domain in the presence of
the Prince. The following day was Anzac Day,
and the 1920 commemoration will be long remembered
on account of the Prince joining in the
service to honour the heroes of the Gallipoli
expedition.</p>

<p>On Monday His Royal Highness attended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Auckland Domain, where the school children of
the city were marshalled into groups, forming the
word &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; and a living Union Jack, and as
the Prince passed among the children the enthusiasm
was unprecedented. In the afternoon the
Royal visitor attended a race meeting at Ellerslie,
specially arranged in honour of his visit, and at
night he was present at an &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; in the Town
Hall, where he was again received with enthusiasm.
Thus ended the official part of the Prince&rsquo;s visit,
but owing to the railwaymen&rsquo;s strike he spent a few
days privately in the city.</p>

<h2><a name="Appendix_I" id="Appendix_I">Appendix I</a><br />
<i>The Name of Auckland</i></h2>

<p>The City of Auckland is generally stated to have been
named after Lord Auckland by Governor Hobson, but,
as a rule, no authority for the statement appears in any
of the books relating to the subject. As already shown
from Hobson&rsquo;s despatch, dated 10th November, 1840,
the Governor chose the name himself. So far, so good.
What was his reason for doing so? I exhausted every
possible source of information at my command, and
failed to obtain any satisfaction. Learning from Mr.
Horace Fildes, of Wellington, that Dr. Guy H. Scholefield
had, while in England, been given access by the
Hobson family to the late Governor&rsquo;s papers, and from
these had written a biography (which, unfortunately, is
still in manuscript), I communicated with him on the
question of the naming of the city, and specifically inquired
if he had seen any document or paper giving in
Hobson&rsquo;s own words his reasons for the name which he
bestowed upon the capital. Dr. Scholefield courteously
looked through his MS. and replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come across the volume and looked carefully
through it for what you want. Here it is, roughly.
Having been idle for some years after returning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the West Indies, Hobson applied to the First Lord (Sir
James Graham), recounting his services and asking for
employment. This was shelved, but in June, 1834, Lord
Auckland came to the Admiralty, and in December he
gave Hobson command of the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, with orders
to proceed to the East Indies (the cruise which brought
him first to New Zealand). Hobson wrote thanking
Auckland for his patronage, and Auckland replied a few
days later:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am glad to know from you that your appointment
to the <i>Rattlesnake</i> is so satisfactory to you, and can assure
you that it was highly pleasing to me to give the service
the advantage of having you again in active employment.&rsquo;
(<i>Private letter in possession of Hobson&rsquo;s family</i>).</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Hobson was on the East Indies station Auckland
was himself appointed Governor-General of India.
Troubles with Burma for months, and even for years,
made it seem that an expedition would be necessary, and
both before and after the Australian cruise, Hobson had
been instructed to be ready for this, as he would be senior
naval officer on the station. Finally, Hobson&rsquo;s time came
to return to England, and the instructions were handed
over to another captain. In his letters to his wife at this
period, which I have copied, but cannot find just now,
Hobson frequently refers in terms of gratitude to Auckland&rsquo;s
kindly interest. At one time he expected a naval
appointment at Bombay worth £2000 a year, which
he compared with a &lsquo;factorship&rsquo; in New Zealand or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
governorship of Port Philip, which he surveyed. His
conclusion was rather in favour of the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my chapter on Hobson&rsquo;s character, I refer to his
frequent acknowledgments of the kindly interest of three
men, Sir Lawrence Halsted, Lord Auckland and the Duke
of Clarence. He has commemorated them and others
in the nomenclature of Australia and New Zealand,
wherever he had a chance. &lsquo;Believe me,&rsquo; he writes to his
wife in 1836, regarding the kindly interest of Lord
Auckland, &lsquo;many a valuable officer pines in obscurity
merely because he has no friends to bring his merits
into notice.&rsquo; The friendship of Lord Auckland was well
recognised, for an acquaintance once asked him to exert
his influence on behalf of his own son-in-law. &lsquo;It would
gratify me beyond measure,&rsquo; he writes to Mrs. Hobson
in reply &lsquo;to be the means of pushing his son-in-law
forward, but to write to Lord Auckland, as &mdash;&mdash; wishes
me to do, to ask his Lordship&rsquo;s interest on behalf of
another, merely because he befriended me, is so absurd
a thing that I cannot help wondering how any rational
man could propose it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that this may be sufficient to fix the responsibility
for the name of Auckland. There can be no
historical doubt as to its origin, and the reason for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The marriage of Kati with Matere Toha, brought about in
accordance with ancient Maori custom, was designed to perpetuate
the peace made between the Northern and the local
tribes. The high rank of both Kati and Matere Toha, and their
personal influence and worth, made the union a great success
from the diplomatic standpoint. The marriage was one of the
epoch-making events of local Maori history, and was a happy
consummation to all the events that had gone before. Kati and
his wife lived and died at Mangere. At their death they were
interred in the old cemetery near by the venerable church which
was erected by the Maoris on the Mangere hillside in those far-off
days as a token of the advent of Christianity among their people.</p></div>
